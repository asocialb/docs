# AddLiveWatermark

## 1. API Description

Domain name for API request: live.intl.tencentcloudapi.com.

After a watermark is added and a watermark ID is successfully returned, you need to call the [CreateLiveWatermarkRule](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/32629?from_cn_redirect=1) API to bind the watermark ID to a stream.
After the number of watermarks exceeds the upper limit of 100, to add a new watermark, you must delete an old one first.

A maximum of 100 requests can be initiated per second for this API.
