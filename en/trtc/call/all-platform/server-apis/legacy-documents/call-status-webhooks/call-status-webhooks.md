# Call Status Webhooks

To facilitate refined control of your call services, the TRTC Call (TUICallKit) offers call status callbacks. Your business backend can use these callbacks to peek at users' call results in real-time, such as missed calls, rejections, etc., and based on this, perform real-time data analytics and other operations. For calling configuration methods, see [Callback Configuration API List](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/60135#).

## Use Conditions

- Only applications (SDKAppId) that have activated the **Group Call Version** of TRTC Call can use the call status callback. You can also activate the trial version for free to test. For version descriptions and activation instructions, refer to [Activate the Service](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/59832#).
- Currently, call status callbacks are available only in specific versions of TUICallKit across various platforms, as detailed in the table below:

| Platform/Framework | Version number |
| --- | --- |
| Android/iOS/Flutter/uni-app (client) | â¥  1.7.1 |
| Web | â¥  1.4.6 |
| WeChat Mini Program | â¥  1.5.1 |

> **Note:**Only after all participating platforms/frameworks are upgraded to the versions mentioned above, can the corresponding call information be peeked at in the console.

## Notes

- To enable the callback, you must configure the callback URL and enable the switch for this command. Please refer to [Create Callback Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/60134#).
- The direction of the callback is from the Callkit backend to the app backend via an HTTP POST request.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.

## Scenarios that may trigger this callback

Actions performed by app users through the client during a call, such as hanging up, etc.

## Timing of the callback

After the call ends.

## Possible callback results

| Callback status | Result indication |
| --- | --- |
| Missed call: Recipient timeout before answering | not_answer |
| Declined call: Recipient declined the call | reject |
| Busy Line: Busy line | call_busy |
| Cancel: Caller canceled the call before connecting | cancel |
| Completion: Call connected and ended normally | normal_end |
| Interruption: Call interrupted due to network or other reasons | interrupt |

| UserId | String | Operating User ID |
| RoomId | String | Operating Room ID |
| TotalNum | Integer | Number of Participants in Call |
| MediaType | String | Media Type:`Audio` Audio Call`Video` Video Call |
| CallType | String | Call Type:`Single` Audio Call`Group` Video Call |
| CallId | String | Call Unique ID |
| Role | String | role :`Caller` User ID`Callee` User ID |
| CallResult | String | Call Result, only filled in during the end event, otherwise empty:`Cancel`: Caller canceled the call before connection`Reject` Declined: Recipient declined the call`Not_answer` Missed call: Recipient did not answer in time`Normal_end` Completion: Call connected and ended normally`Call_busy` Busy line: Busy line during call`Interrupt` Interruption: Call interrupted due to network or other reasons |
| EventTime | Integer | Timestamp of operation (second-level) |
| StartCallTs | Integer | Timestamp when call is initiated (second-level) only returned on normal_end |
| AcceptTs | Integer | Timestamp when call is answered (second-level) only returned on normal_end |
| EndTs | Integer | Timestamp when call ends (second-level) only returned on normal_end |

> **Note:**CallResult field shows all types only for one-on-one calls, group chat only has `normal_end`.

### Callback Response Example

A callback response packet is sent after the app backend synchronizes the data.

```
{    "ErrorCode": 0,    "ErrorMessage": "Success"}
```

### Response Packet Field Description

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ErrorCode | Integer | 0 indicates success, all other values indicate failure |
| ErrorMessage | String | Your server response can carry error information as defined |

> **Note:**It is recommended that your server responds with the correct response packet promptly after receiving the request packet correctly, otherwise, it will trigger a system retry. The retry mechanism is as follows.

## Retry mechanism

- When to trigger a retry

ErrorCode = 0 is considered a successful callback, otherwise, it will trigger a retry.

An HTTP request error to your appServer will also trigger a retry.

- Retry interval

Retry interval: `0s, 1s, 1s, 2s, 3s, 5s`. If all attempts fail, the process will be abandoned.
