## Environment preparations

- Android 5.0 (SDK API Level 21) or later.
- Gradle 4.2.1 or later.
- Android system devices: mobile phone, tablet, or other custom devices.

## Step 1: Prepare the conditions

1. Before using the USB Camera feature provided by Tencent Cloud, you need to go to the console to enable audio and video services for your application and purchase the Group Call Plan. For detailed steps, please refer to [Activate Service](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/59832#).
2. This plugin needs to be used in conjunction with the TUICallKit Component. Please integrate the TUICallKit Component first:
  - [Android](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/50991#)
  - [Flutter](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/54896#)

## Step 2: Integrate the component

In the `build.gradle` file in the app directory of your project, add the following dependency code:

```
implementation "io.trtc.uikit:usb-camera:latest.release"
```

After completing the above steps, you can use an external camera for video calls in the `TUICallKit` component.

## FAQs

### Cannot open camera on Android 9 and Android 10 devices?

**Cause**: On Android 9 and Android 10, requesting USB permissions will also check for Camera permissions. However, due to an anomaly in the Android framework, even if Camera permissions are granted, the check still fails, preventing USB permissions from being granted.

**Solution**: Modify the app's targetSdkVersion to 27 or lower.

```
defaultConfig {
    targetSdkVersion 27
}
```
