# APNs

TUICallKit components support offline push through the integration of the push plugin. To help developers easily implement offline push in their projects, we recommend using the TIMPush plugin (paid). TIMPush push plugin has the following advantages:

- The integration cycle is short, with full-manufacturer access expected to take only 30 minutes.
- Supports data statistics and link tracking, making it convenient for you to view various indicators such as push reach rate, click-through rate, and conversion rate.
- Supports full-staff/Tag push, allowing you to push marketing ads, notifications, news information, and other content to all users or specified groups.
- Supports cross-platform frameworks like uni-app and Flutter.

> **Description****ï¼**In order to achieve better notification effects for audio and video calls, we recommend that you use the TUIVoIPExtension plug-in to access the VoIP push function. For Chinese mainland, we recommend that you use [TUIVoIPExtension/LiveCommunicationKit](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/72208) for access, and for non-Chinese mainland, we recommend that you use [TUIVoIPExtension/CallKit](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/51000) for access.

2. [Activate remote push for the app](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/54923#push_notifacation).
3. [Generate certificate](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/54923#certificates).
4. [Upload certificates to the Tencent RTC Console](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/54923#UploadCertificate).
5. [Complete Project Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/54923#Xcode_config)
6. [Configure push parameters](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/54923#456f744f-f465-4d48-8088-17fa8c95b12f).
7. [Dial offline push calls](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/54923#offlinepushcall).

### Step 1. Integrate the TIMPush component

1. The TIMPush component supports CocoaPods integration. You need to add the component dependencies in the Podfile.

```
target 'YourAppName' do  # Uncommment the next line if you're using Swift or would like to use dynamic frameworks  use_frameworks!  use_modular_headers!    # Pods for Example  pod 'TIMPush', '7.9.5668'end
```

2. Run the following command to install the TIMPush component.

```
pod install
# If you cannot install the latest version of TUIKit, run the following command to update the local CocoaPods repository list.
pod repo update
```

### Step 2: **Activate remote push for the app**

1. Log in to the [Apple Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/account/) website, click on the **Certificates, IDs & Profiles** tab, then **Identifiers**, and enter **Certificates**, **Identifiers & Profiles** page.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/e52ebeff496511efb36952540075b605.png)

2. Click the **+** next to **Identifiers**.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/e51a5158496511efb36952540075b605.png)

3. You can follow the steps below to create a new AppID, or add the `Push Notification` `Service` to your existing AppID.

> **Note:**It's important to note that your app's `Bundle ID` must not use the wildcard *, otherwise, the remote push service cannot be used.

4. Select **App IDs**, click **Continue** to proceed to the next step.
5. Select **App**, click **Continue** to proceed to the next step.
6. Configure the `Bundle ID` and other information, click **Continue** to proceed to the next step.
7. Select **Push Notifications** to activate the remote push service.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/e5190ed0496511ef8357525400bdab9d.png)

****

### Step 3: Generate the push certificate

1. Select your **AppID**, find the **Push Notifications** configuration option, and choose **Configure**.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/e52a1bbd496511ef8357525400bdab9d.png)

2. In the **Apple Push Notification service SSL Certificates** window, you will see two `SSL Certificates`, one for the Development environment and one for the Production environment.
3. We first select the development environment (Development) option **Create Certificate**, and the system will prompt us that a **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)** is needed.
4. On a Mac, open the Keychain Access tool (**Keychain Access**), and from the menu, select **Keychain Access** > **Certificate Assistant** > **Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority** (`Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority`).

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/e5451448496511ef8357525400bdab9d.png)

5. Enter your email address, common name (your name or company name), select **Saved to disk**, and click **Continue**. The system will generate a `*.certSigningRequest` file.
6. Go back to the page on the Apple Developer website from [Step 3](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/54923#step3) just now and click  "Choose File" to upload the generated `*.certSigningRequest` file.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/e54ac43d496511efb36952540075b605.png)

7. Click **Continue** to generate the push certificate.
8. Click **Download** to download the `Development SSL Certificate` for the development environment to your local machine.
9. Follow the steps 1-8 again to download the `Production SSL Certificate` for your production environment to your local system.

> **Note:**The production environment certificate is actually a merged certificate of `Sandbox` and `Production`, which can be used for both the development and production environments.

10. Double-click the downloaded `SSL Certificate` for both the development and production environments, and the system will import it into your keychain.
11. Open the Keychain Access app, **log in to** **My Certificates**, right-click to export the P12 files for both the newly created development environment (`Apple Development IOS Push Service`) and the production environment (`Apple Push Services`).

> **Note:**When saving the `P12` file, be sure to set a password.

### Step 4: Upload the certificate to the Tencent RTC console

1. Log in to the [Tencent RTC Console](https://console.trtc.io/).
2. Click on the Target Application Card, select the **Chat** Tag on the left, click on **Push**, then click on **Access settings**.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/e54aa0b1496511ef9bf1525400a9236a.png)

3. Click on **iOS Native Offline Push Settings** on the right side to **Add Certificate**.
4. Select Certificate Type, upload the iOS Certificate (p12), set the Certificate Password, and click on **Confirm**.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/e55b43e1496511ef9bf1525400a9236a.png)

> **Note:**We recommend naming the uploaded certificate in English (special characters such as brackets are not allowed).You need to set a password for the uploaded certificate. Without a password, push notifications cannot be received.For an app published on App Store, the environment of the certificate must be the production environment. Otherwise, push notifications cannot be received.The uploaded .p12 certificate must be your own authentic and valid certificate.

5. After the push certificate information is generated, record the certificate ID. It will be used as a **mandatory parameter** in [Step 6: Configure push parameters](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/54923#456f744f-f465-4d48-8088-17fa8c95b12f).

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/e5571cfb496511ef998b525400f69702.png)

### Step 5: Complete the project configuration

To add the required permissions to your application, enable the push notification feature in your Xcode project.

Open the **Xcode** project, go to **Project** > **Target** > **Capabilities** page, click the **+** inside the red frame, then select and add **Push Notifications**. The result after adding is shown in the yellow frame in the picture:

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/e54f89f7496511ef9bf1525400a9236a.png)

### Step 6: Configure push parameters

You need to implement the protocol method `offlinePushCertificateID` in AppDelegate to return the Certificate ID.

Swift

Objective-C

```
import TIMPushfunc offlinePushCertificateID() -> Int32 {    return kAPNSBusiId}
```

```
#pragma mark - TIMPush- (int)offlinePushCertificateID {    return kAPNSBusiId;}
```

### Step 7: Dial offline push calls

Please set the offlinePushInfo field of params when making a call using calls.

Swift

Objective-C

```
import TUICallKit_Swiftimport RTCRoomEnginelet pushInfo: TUIOfflinePushInfo = TUIOfflinePushInfo()pushInfo.title = ""pushInfo.desc = "You have a new call"pushInfo.iOSPushType = .apnspushInfo.ignoreIOSBadge = falsepushInfo.iOSSound = "phone_ringing.mp3"pushInfo.androidSound = "phone_ringing"// For OPPO, you must set the `ChannelID` to receive push messages.

```

```

```

## Advanced features: continuous vibration, ringing

**APNs (Apple Push Notification service)** push can specify features such as pushing audio files, but it cannot vibrate or ring continuously. The notification duration is short, and inbound call information is easy to miss in audio/video call scenarios. You can use our [Demo experience APNs continuous vibration and ringing feature](https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/TUICallKit/tree/main/iOS/Example).

### 1. Ring

APNs push can set the iOSSound field in [TUIOfflinePushInfo](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/54902#TUIOfflinePushInfo) of params when calling call, calls, groupCall APIs to make a phone call. Pass the audio filename to iOSSound.

> **Note:**If you want to customize iOSSound, you need to first link the audio file into the Xcode project, and then set the audio filename (with extension) to iOSSound.Ringtone duration should be less than 30 s.

Objective-C

Swift

```
[[TUICallKit createInstance] call:@"mike's id" params:[self getCallParams] callMediaType:TUICallMediaTypeVideo];- (TUICallParams *)getCallParams {    TUIOfflinePushInfo *offlinePushInfo = [self createOfflinePushInfo];    TUICallParams *callParams = [TUICallParams new];    callParams.offlinePushInfo = offlinePushInfo;    callParams.timeout = 30;    return callParams;}+ (TUIOfflinePushInfo *)createOfflinePushInfo {    TUIOfflinePushInfo *pushInfo = [TUIOfflinePushInfo new];    pushInfo.title = @"";    pushInfo.desc = TUICallingLocalize(@"TUICallKit.have.new.invitation");    pushInfo.iOSPushType = TUICallIOSOfflinePushTypeAPNs;    pushInfo.ignoreIOSBadge = NO;    pushInfo.iOSSound = @"phone_ringing.mp3";    pushInfo.AndroidSound = @"phone_ringing";    // OPPO must set ChannelID before it can receive push messages. This channelID needs to be consistent with that in the console.    // OPPO must set a ChannelID to receive push messages. This channelID needs to be the same as the console.    pushInfo.AndroidOPPOChannelID = @"tuikit";    // FCM channel ID, you need change PrivateConstants.java and set "fcmPushChannelId"    pushInfo.AndroidFCMChannelID = @"fcm_push_channel";    // VIVO message type: 0-push message, 1-System message(have a higher delivery rate)    pushInfo.AndroidVIVOClassification = 1;    // HuaWei message type: https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides/message-classification-0000001149358835    pushInfo.AndroidHuaWeiCategory = @"IM";    return pushInfo;}
```

```
let params = TUICallParams()let pushInfo: TUIOfflinePushInfo = TUIOfflinePushInfo()pushInfo.title = "TUICallKit"pushInfo.desc = "TUICallKit.have.new.invitation"pushInfo.iOSPushType = .apnspushInfo.ignoreIOSBadge = falsepushInfo.iOSSound = "phone_ringing.mp3"pushInfo.androidSound = "phone_ringing"// OPPO must set ChannelID before it can receive push messages.

```

### 2. Continuous Vibration

**Notification Service Extension** (abbreviated as Extension) is an Extension in iOS used to intercept and modify push notification content. With the aid of the Extension, long-term vibration can be achieved.

The primary application and Extension are two independent processes. After receiving an APNs push, the primary application will not be activated, while the Extension will be activated. Turn on continuous vibration in the Extension. When the application switches to the foreground, inform the Extension via inter-process communication to turn off the vibration and ringtone.

#### 2.1 Enable Mutable Content

Use `Notification Service Extension` to achieve continuous vibration. First, enable the `mutable-content` switch in the console.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/6a89c574106711f0ae09525400bf7822.png)

#### 2.2 Create an Extension Project

In the Xcode project, select `Editor > Add Target > Notification Service Extension` to create an Extension. The newly created Extension Target needs to configure the Apple certificate. For specific methods, you can [refer here](https://trtc.io/document/60548?platform=web&product=chat&menulabel=uikit#22ce926d-49b8-439f-8547-8dad1d135279).

The newly created Extension contains a source code file named **NotificationService**, with the following content:

```
// NotificationService.swiftimport UserNotificationsclass NotificationService: UNNotificationServiceExtension {    var contentHandler: ((UNNotificationContent) -> Void)?    var bestAttemptContent: UNMutableNotificationContent?    override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) {        self.contentHandler = contentHandler        bestAttemptContent = (request.content.mutableCopy() as? UNMutableNotificationContent)        if let bestAttemptContent = bestAttemptContent {            // Modify the notification content here...            bestAttemptContent.title = "\\(bestAttemptContent.title) [modified]"            contentHandler(bestAttemptContent)        }    }    override func serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire() {        // Called just before the extension will be terminated by the system.        // Use this as an opportunity to deliver your "best attempt" at modified content, otherwise the original push payload will be used.        if let contentHandler = contentHandler, let bestAttemptContent =  bestAttemptContent {            contentHandler(bestAttemptContent)        }    }}
```

- **didReceive**: When a push notification is received and the Extension is activated, the didReceive callback is executed. Users can complete the modification of push notification information in didReceive. After completing the modification, call the contentHandler() method. The Extension execution ends.
- **serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire**: When a push notification is received and the Extension is activated, if the Extension does not respond (does not execute the contentHandler() method) for more than 30 seconds, the serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire callback method will be called, and the contentHandler() method will be called within this method. The Extension execution ends.

#### 2.3 Vibrate When a Push Notification Is Received

1. When a push notification is received and the Extension is activated, turn on vibration when the didReceive callback is executed.
2. Turn off vibration and ringtone after receiving serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire.

**The modified code is as follows:**

```
// NotificationService.swiftimport UserNotificationsclass NotificationService: UNNotificationServiceExtension {    var contentHandler: ((UNNotificationContent) -> Void)?    var bestAttemptContent: UNMutableNotificationContent?    override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) {        self.contentHandler = contentHandler        bestAttemptContent = (request.content.mutableCopy() as? UNMutableNotificationContent)        if let bestAttemptContent = bestAttemptContent {                        contentHandler(bestAttemptContent)        }                // start ringing, VibratorFeature.start() needs to be implemented by yourself        VibratorFeature.start()    }    override func serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire() {        if let contentHandler = contentHandler, let bestAttemptContent =  bestAttemptContent {            /// If there is no response for more than 30 seconds, the vibration and ringing function will be turned off.            // stop ringing, RingingFeature.shared.stop() needs to be implemented by yourself            VibratorFeature.stop()            contentHandler(bestAttemptContent)        }    }}
```

> **Note:**The methods of starting vibration `VibratorFeature.start()` and stopping vibration `VibratorFeature.stop()` used in the above code need to be implemented by the customer.

#### 2.4 Turn Off Vibration in Main Application

Upon receiving a push, start vibration and ringing. When the user enters the APP, the vibration in the Extension should be turned off. The primary application and the Extension are two independent processes. CFNotificationCenterGetDarwinNotifyCenter can be used to send notifications. When the APP enters the foreground, the primary application sends a notification to the Extension. The Extension listens for the notification and turns off the vibration upon receipt.

**The modified code is as follows:**

```
// Versions prior to iOS 13 monitor the foreground or background status through AppDelegate applicationWillEnterForeground// AppDelegate.swiftclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {    func applicationWillEnterForeground(_ application: UIApplication) {      ...          sendStopRingingToExtension()    }    func sendStopRingingToExtension() {        CFNotificationCenterPostNotification(CFNotificationCenterGetDarwinNotifyCenter(),                                             CFNotificationName("APNsStopRinging" as CFString), nil, nil, true)    }}// Starting from iOS 13, monitor the foreground or background status through SceneDelegate sceneWillEnterForeground// SceneDelegate.swiftclass SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate {    func sceneWillEnterForeground(_ scene: UIScene) {        ...        sendStopRingingToExtension()    }    func sendStopRingingToExtension() {        CFNotificationCenterPostNotification(CFNotificationCenterGetDarwinNotifyCenter(),                                             CFNotificationName("APNsStopRinging" as CFString), nil, nil, true)    }}
```

```
// NotificationService.swiftimport UserNotificationsclass NotificationService: UNNotificationServiceExtension {    var contentHandler: ((UNNotificationContent) -> Void)?    var bestAttemptContent: UNMutableNotificationContent?    override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) {        self.contentHandler = contentHandler        bestAttemptContent = (request.content.mutableCopy() as? UNMutableNotificationContent)        if let bestAttemptContent = bestAttemptContent {                    contentHandler(bestAttemptContent)        }                // start ringing, VibratorFeature.start() needs to be implemented by yourself        VibratorFeature.start()        registerObserver()    }    override func serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire() {        if let contentHandler = contentHandler, let bestAttemptContent =  bestAttemptContent {            /// If there is no response for more than 30 seconds, the vibration and ringing function will be turned off.            // stop ringing, RingingFeature.shared.stop() needs to be implemented by yourself            VibratorFeature.stop()            contentHandler(bestAttemptContent)        }    }        private func registerObserver() {        CFNotificationCenterAddObserver(CFNotificationCenterGetDarwinNotifyCenter(),                                        Unmanaged.passUnretained(self).toOpaque(), { center, pointer, name, _, userInfo in            VibratorFeature.stop()        }, "APNsStopRinging" as CFString, nil, .deliverImmediately)    }}
```

## FAQs

### Not receiving push notifications, and the backend reports a bad deviceToken?

Apple's deviceToken is related to the current compilation environment. If the certificate ID and token used to log in to IMSDK and upload the deviceToken to Tencent Cloud do not match, an error will occur.

- If compiled in the Release environment, the `- application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:` callback returns a token for the deployment environment. In this case, the businessID should be set to the production environment's Certificate ID.
- If compiled in the Debug environment, the `- application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:` callback returns a token for the development environment. In this case, the businessID should be set to the development environment's Certificate ID.

### In the iOS development environment, is there an occasional lack of return for the deviceToken or a failure in the APNs request for the token?

This problem is caused by instability of APNs. You can fix it in the following ways:

1. Insert a SIM card into the phone and use the 4G network.
2. Uninstall and reinstall the application, restart the application, or shut down and restart the phone.
3. Use a package for the production environment.
4. Use another iPhone.
