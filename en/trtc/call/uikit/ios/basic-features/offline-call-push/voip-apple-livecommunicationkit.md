# VoIP (Apple LiveCommunicationKit)

TUICallKit component supports VoIP push functionality through the TUIVoIPExtension/LiveCommunicationKit push plugin. TUICallKit provides you with two integration methods: TUIVoIPExtension/LiveCommunicationKit plugin (paid) and [self-integrated push](#**2.-how-to-self-integrate-voip-push-functionality**) (free). We recommend using the TUIVoIPExtension/LiveCommunicationKit push plugin to implement offline push. The TUIVoIPExtension/LiveCommunicationKit push plugin has the following advantages:

- Short integration cycle, expected full vendor integration takes only 30 minutes.
- Supports data statistics and link tracking, making it convenient for you to view various metrics such as push reach rate, click rate, and conversion rate.
- Better audio/video call notification effects, improving call reach rate.
- Supports cross-platform frameworks such as Flutter.

> **Noteï¼****TUIVoIPExtension** is a sub-module of **TIMPush**. Due to the special nature of **VoIP** push, **TUIVoIPExtension** is released independently. To use the **TUIVoIPExtension** plugin, you first need to [activate TIMPush service.](#1.-activate-service)

> **Description****ï¼**TUIVoIPExtension/LiveCommunicationKit plugin needs to be used on iOS 17.4 and above systems.VoIP Push cannot reuse APNs regular push certificates and requires a separate [VoIP Push certificate application](#2.-vendor-configuration) on the Apple Developer website.

Go to [IM Console > Plugin Market](https://console.tencentcloud.com/im/plugin/TIMPush), click **Buy Now** or **Free Trial** (each application can have one free trial, valid for 7 days).

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/63cc8c52687011f0a1c55254005ef0f7.png)

> **Noteï¼**After the push plugin trial or purchase expires, push services (including regular message offline push, all-user/tag push, and other services) will automatically stop. To avoid affecting your normal business operations, please [purchase](https://buy.tencentcloud.com/avc?activeId=plugin&regionId=1)/[renew](https://console.tencentcloud.com/account/renewal) in advance.

### 2. Vendor Configuration

#### Step 1: Apply for VoIP Push Certificate

Before applying for a VoIP Push certificate, please first log in to the [Apple Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/account/) website and enable remote push functionality for your App. After your AppID has Push Notification capability, follow these steps to apply for and configure the VoIP Push certificate:

1. Log in to the [Apple Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/account/) website, click **Certificates, IDs & Profiles** tab, then **Certificates**, to enter the **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** page.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/4a426563662811f09a9d52540044a08e.png)

2. Click the **+** next to Certificates.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/52f364bc662811f0b5365254001c06ec.png)

3. In the **Create a New Certificate** tab, select **VoIP Services Certificate**, and click **Continue**.
4. In the **Select an App ID for your VoIP Service Certificate** tab, select your current App's BundleID, and click **Continue**.
5. Next, the system prompts that we need a **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**.
6. We will create a CSR file next. First, open **Keychain Access** on Mac, select **Keychain Access** > **Certificate Assistant** > **Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority** from the menu (`Keychain Access - Certificate Assistant - Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority`).

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/589ba754662811f09a9d52540044a08e.png)

7. Enter your email address, common name (your name or company name), select **Save to disk**, click continue, and the system will generate a `*.certSigningRequest` file.

Return to the Apple Developer website page from **Step 5** above, click **Choose File** to upload the generated `*.certSigningRequest` file.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/60d0cbff662811f0924f5254005ef0f7.png)

8. Click Continue to generate the certificate, then click Download to download the corresponding certificate to your local machine.
9. Double-click to open the downloaded `voip_services.cer`, and the system will import it into the keychain.
10. Open the Keychain application, go to **Login** > **My Certificates**, right-click to export the newly created VoIP Services `P12` file.

> **Descriptionï¼**When saving the `P12` file, please make sure to set a password for it.

#### Step 2: Upload Certificate to IM Console

[Open IM Console](https://console.tencentcloud.com/im/detail), select your created IM application, and follow these steps to upload the certificate:

1. Select your IM application, go to the Access Settings page of Push.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/f5385a05687011f09a20525400bf7822.png)

2. In **Vendor Configuration**, switch to **iOS**, click the **Add Certificate** button, then select the certificate type in the floating page, upload the iOS certificate (p.12), set the certificate password, and click **Confirm**.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/1bac7057687311f09cbf525400454e06.png)

> **Description****ï¼**When adding certificates, the push type defaults to APNS, which does not affect the upload and use of VoIP certificates.VoIP Push certificates themselves do not distinguish between production and testing environments. Production and development environments use the same VoIP Push certificate, please upload separately.Certificate names uploaded should preferably use all English (especially avoid special characters like parentheses).Uploaded certificates need to set a password, otherwise push notifications cannot be received.Certificates for App Store release need to be set to production environment, otherwise push notifications cannot be received.The uploaded p12 certificate must be a real and valid certificate you applied for yourself.

3. After upload is complete, record the certificate IDs for different environments.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/25a3afe5662911f08e915254007c27c5.png)

> **Description****ï¼**Certificate IDs for development and production environments must be strictly distinguished, please fill in according to the actual environment.

## Feature Integration

### 2. Integrate TUIVoIPExtension Component

Use CocoaPods to import the component, follow these specific steps:

1. Add the following dependency to your `Podfile` file.

```
pod 'TUIVoIPExtension/LiveCommunicationKit'
```

2. Execute the following command to install the component.

```
pod update
```

3. Report the [console certificate ID](#2.-vendor-configuration).

Swift

Objective-C

```
import TUIVoIPExtensionfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {        // Report certificate ID     TUIVoIPExtension.setCertificateID(1234)        return true}
```

```
#import <TUIVoIPExtension/TUIVoIPExtension.h>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {        //Report certificate ID    [TUIVoIPExtension setCertificateID:1234];        return YES;}
```

## Make VoIP Calls

If you need to make VoIP calls, you need to set the iOSPushType field in OfflinePushInfo to TUICallIOSOfflinePushTypeVoIP when calling calls, the default is TUICallIOSOfflinePushTypeAPNs.

Swift

Java

Dart

Objective-C

## Common Issues

### 1. Cannot get VoIP Push, how to handle?

1. First check whether the App's running environment and certificate environment are consistent, and whether the certificate ID matches. If they are inconsistent, push notifications cannot be received.
2. Please confirm whether the current logged-in account is in offline status: press home key to switch to background, or actively kill the process after login. VoIP Push currently only supports push notifications in offline status.
3. Check whether [Complete Project Configuration](#1.-complete-project-configuration) is correct.
4. **Try restarting the test phone to clear system cache and memory (very important).**

### **2. How to Self-Integrate VoIP Push Functionality**

We also support you to integrate VoIP push capabilities yourself through SDK methods. The overall solution design is as follows:
