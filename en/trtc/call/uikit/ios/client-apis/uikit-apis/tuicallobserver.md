## Details

### onError

An error occurred.

> **Note:**This callback indicates that the SDK encountered an unrecoverable error. Such errors must be listened for, and UI reminders should be sent to users if necessary.

```

```

The parameters are described below:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| code | int | The error code. |
| message | NSString | The error message. |

### onCallReceived

A call invitation was received. This callback is received by an invitee. You can listen for this event to determine whether to display the incoming call view.

```

| info | [TUICallObserverExtraInfo](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/54902#TUICallObserverExtraInfo) | Extended information |

### onCallBegin

The call was connected. This callback is received by both the inviter and invitees. You can listen for this event to determine whether to start on-cloud recording, content moderation, or other tasks.

```

### onCallEnd

The call ended. This callback is received by both the inviter and invitees. You can listen for this event to determine when to display call information such as call duration and call type, or stop on-cloud recording.

```
- (void)onCallEnd:(NSString *)callId mediaType:(TUICallMediaType)mediaType reason:(TUICallEndReason)reason userId:(NSString *)userId totalTime:(float)totalTime info:(TUICallObserverExtraInfo *)info;

| info | [TUICallObserverExtraInfo](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/54902#TUICallObserverExtraInfo) | Extended information |

> **Note:**Client-side callbacks are often lost when errors occur, for example, when the process is closed. If you need to measure the duration of a call for billing or other purposes, we recommend you use the RESTful API.

### onCallNotConnected

This indicates that the call was canceled by the caller, timed out by the callee, rejected by the callee, or the callee was busy. There are multiple scenarios involved. You can listen to this event to achieve UI logic such as missed calls and resetting UI status.

- Call cancellation by the caller: The caller receives the callback (userId is himself); the callee receives the callback (userId is the ID of the caller)
- Callee timeout: The caller will simultaneously receive the [onUserNoResponse](#onUserNoResponse) and onCallNotConnected callbacks (userId is his own ID); the callee receives the onCallNotConnected callback (userId is his own ID)
- Callee rejection: The caller will simultaneously receive the [onUserReject](#onUserReject) and onCallNotConnected callbacks (userId is his own ID); the callee receives the onCallNotConnected callback (userId is his own ID)
- Callee busy: The caller will simultaneously receive the [onUserLineBusy](#onUserLineBusy) and onCallNotConnected callbacks (userId is his own ID);
- Abnormal interruption: The callee failed to receive the call ï¼he receives this callback (userId is his own ID).

```
