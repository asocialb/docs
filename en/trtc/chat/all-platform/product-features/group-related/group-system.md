# Group System

## Group System Overview

The group system is an instant messaging system that allows multiple participants to communicate in one chat. The group system has the following basic capabilities:

- Comprehensive [group management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33530) capabilities: Group creation and disbanding, member management, group profile management, member profile management, and more.
- Stable and reliable messaging and a sophisticated [group message](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33526) management mechanism: Permission control, muting/unmuting, message callback, message roaming, and more.
- Based on common use cases, Chat provides the following default group types: **Work** , **Public** , **Meeting** , **AVChatRoom** , and **Community** .
- Upper limit on the number of group members:
  - The number of members in a Work, Public, or Meeting group can be increased to a maximum of 6,000 if fees are paid. For more information, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350).
  - A Community group supports up to 100,000 members per group.
  - There is no upper limit on the number of members in an AVChatRoom.

> **Note:**Although AVChatRoom supports unlimited group members, if a spike in group members is expected within a short time (in scenarios such as large online events where the number of members in a single group reaches 50,000 or above), contact [Tencent Cloud Customer Service](https://www.tencentcloud.com/contact-us) in advance and notify for resource allocation by providing the SDKAppID and the expected event time.Currently, historical message storage is available only for non-AVChatRoom groups, with messages stored for 7 days for the Trial Edition and Standard Edition, 30 days for the Pro Edition, and 90 days for the Pro Plus Edition and Enterprise Edition by default. If you require a longer storage period, change the storage period of historical messages in the [console](https://console.trtc.io/). Increasing the storage period of historical messages is a value-added service. For more information on pricing, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350).Community is a new powerful tool for entertainment collaboration. Within the same community, a high number of members can be divided into different groups and topics to separate messages for hierarchical communication, yet they can also share the same set of friend relationships. This helps you develop a unique path of social expansion. The community feature is widely suitable for diverse use cases, such as finding like-minded people, game-based social networking, fan marketing, and organization management.The Community feature is supported by the SDK of the Enhanced edition on v5.8.1668 or later and the SDK for web on v2.17.0 or later. You need to [purchase the Pro editionãPro Plus editionãEnterprise edition](https://console.trtc.io/subscription/buy/chat?packType=pro), go to the [**console**](https://console.trtc.io/), select **Group feature configuration**, and enable **Community**.

Chat's group system is highly customizable, allowing you to use:

- [Custom Message Elements](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33527)
- [Custom Group IDs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529#custom-group-ids)
- [Custom Topic IDs](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/33529#custom-group-ids)
- [Custom Fields](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529#custom-fields)
- [Custom Callbacks](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529#custom-callbacks)

## Group Member Roles

The following table lists various group member roles and their permissions:

| Group Member Role | Description | Management Permission |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ordinary member | An ordinary member has no management permissions. | In a Work group, an ordinary member has the permission to modify the group profile. |
| Admin | An admin is appointed by the group owner to assist in managing group members and holds certain management permissions. | Modify the group profile.Remove an ordinary member from the group.Mute an ordinary member, that is, prevent the ordinary member from speaking for a certain period of time.Approve or reject a membership application.Work groups do not support the setting of admins by default. |
| Group owner | A group owner is the creator of a group and has the highest level of management permissions in the group. | The group owner has the following permissions in addition to all permissions held by an admin:Appoint or cancel an admin.Remove an admin from the group.Mute an admin.Disband the group.Transfer the group. |
| Application Admin | This special role has the authority to manage all group permissions in the app and has more power than the group owner. | The Application Admin has the same permissions as the group owner, whether it is a member of the group or not. |

## Group Types

Based on common use cases, Chat provides the following default group types:

| Group type | Applicable scenario |
| --- | --- |
| Work | After a Work group is created, users can join the group only after being invited by group members. The invitation does not need to be accepted by the invitee or approved by the group owner. This group type is the same as private group (Private) in earlier versions. |
| Public | After a Public group is created, the group owner can designate group admins. To join the group, a user needs to search for the group ID and send a request, and the request needs to be approved by the group owner or an admin before the user can join the group. |
| Meeting | A Meeting group allows users to join and leave freely and view historical messages sent before they join the group. Meeting groups are ideal for scenarios that integrate Tencent Real-Time Communication (TRTC), such as audio/video conferencing and online education. This group type is the same as chat room (ChatRoom) in earlier versions. |
| AVChatRoom | An AVChatRoom group allows users to join and exit freely, supports an unlimited number of members, and does not store message history. Audio-video groups can be used with Cloud Streaming Services (CSS) to support on-screen comment chat scenarios. |
| Community | A Community group allows users to join and exit freely, supports up to 100,000 members, and stores message history. To join the group, a user needs to search for the group ID and send an application, and the application does not need to be approved by an admin before the user can join the group. |

> **Note:**Group types have been upgraded in the new SDK version, including **Work Group, Public, Meeting Group, AVChatRoom,**and**Community**. Private and ChatRoom in earlier versions (which had Public, Private, ChatRoom, and AVChatRoom groups) correspond to Work Group and Meeting Group in the new version respectively.Ordinary members of Work Group can modify only the group name, introduction, announcement, and group profile photo URL, but not other group profile information.If the roles within a group type cannot meet your business needs, you can add new roles by setting group member-level [custom fields](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529#custom-fields).To retrieve information about some group members, such as in AVChatRoom scenarios where only a partial member list is displayed.

| Time before a group is automatically repossessed (in seconds). | The backend does not disband groups, unless the group owner disbands the group or all members leave the group. (About group disbanding: the backend does not proactively disband a group unless the group owner disbands the group or the group is automatically disbanded. If automatic disbanding is configured for a group, the backend periodically checks the group and disbands it if no one sends a message in the group for n seconds or the group profile is modified.) | The backend does not disband groups, unless the group owner disbands the group or all members leave the group. |

## Group Data Structure

### Group Basic Information

| Field Name | Type | Description | Notes |

## Permissions in the Permission Group

Management of permissions within a group is primarily accomplished through the permissions detailed in the permission group information and those related to topics. Each bit represents a permission. When a permission bit is set to 1, this permission is granted.

### Meanings of Permissions in the Permission Group

| Permission Name | Description | Permission Bits and Their Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ManageGroupInfo | Permission for modifying the group profile | 1<<0 (left shift to 0 bit, the same below) |
| ManageGroupMember | Permission for adding/deleting members to/from a group or modifying group member information | 1<<1 |
| ManagePermissionGroupInfo | Permission for creating, modifying, and deleting permission groupsPermission for setting permission groups (Add, Modify, and Delete) in all topics | 1<<2 |
| ManagePermissionGroupMember | Permission for adding/deleting members to/from a permission group | 1<<3 |
| ManageTopic | Permission for creating, modifying, and deleting topics | 1<<4 |
| GroupMuteMember | Permission for muting group members | 1<<5 |

| BanMemberGroupMessage | Permission for banning group members | 1<<10 |

## Topic Permissions

| Permission Name | Description | Permission Bits and Their Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ManageTopicInfo | Permission for modifying and deleting topics | 1<<0 (left shift to 0 bit, the same below) |
| ManagePermissionTopicInfo | Permission for setting permission groups (Add, Modify, and Delete) in this topic | 1<<1 |

| TopicAtAll | Permission for using @all when sending messages in topics | 1<<6 |

## Custom Group IDs

When a group is created in the app, Chat assigns a default group ID to the new group. This default group ID starts with @TGS# and is unique in the app.

Chat also allows you to customize group IDs that are simple and easy to remember and communicate. A custom group ID must be a string of ASCII characters (0x20-0x7e) with a length less than 48 bytes. Do not use @TGS# as the prefix to avoid confusion with default group IDs.

> **Note:**The group ID prefix for Community groups must be @TGS#_.

## Custom Topic IDs

When a topic is created in the app, Chat assigns a default topic ID to the new topic by default. The ID starts with `GroupId+@TOPIC#_` and is unique in the group.

To make it easier to remember and communicate the topic ID, Chat allows customizing it in the format of `GroupId+@TOPIC#_+ custom part` during topic creation through the RESTful API in the application. The custom part cannot contain `@TGS#_` and `@TOPIC#_@TOPIC#` (to avoid confusion with the default group ID) and must consist of printable ASCII characters (0x20-0x7e).

For example, if `GroupId` is `@TGS#_@TGS#cQVLVHIM62CJ`, and the custom part is `TestTopic`, the custom topic ID will be `@TGS#_@TGS#cQVLVHIM62CJ@TOPIC#_TestTopic`. The entire custom topic ID must be no longer than 96 bytes.

## Customizing Permission Group IDs

By default, when an app creates a permission group, Chat assigns a default permission group ID to the newly created group. This ID will start with @PMG#_@PMG# and is unique within the group.

To make the permission group ID simpler and easier to remember and disseminate, Chat supports app in customizing the permission group ID through the RESTful API when creating a permission group. The custom permission group ID must start with @PMG#_ (but not with @PMG#_@PMG# to avoid confusion with the default assigned permission group ID) and be printable ASCII characters (  `0x20-0x7e` ).

## Custom Fields

Chat allows you to configure up to 10 group-level custom fields and 5 member-level custom fields based on your business needs. With custom fields, apps can attach additional data to groups, and the data can be read and written through existing APIs.

### Description

Custom fields have the following characteristics:

- Custom fields are structured in key-value format.
- Key is a string with a maximum length of 16 bytes. Its name can only contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores (_).
- Value is a buffer customized by the user, which can be binary data. Group-level values have a maximum length of 512 bytes, while member-level values have a maximum length of 64 bytes.
- You can configure the minimum read permission and minimum write permission for each key.

The read and write permissions of a custom field are listed as follows, from high to low:

1. Readable and writable by the application administrator.
2. Readable and writable by the group owner.
3. Readable and writable by the group admin.
4. Readable and writable by group members.
5. Readable and writable by anyone, including non-members.

For example, an app needs to extend the `GroupLevel` field for groups and the value of this field is a number representing the level of a group. If this level information is calculated by the app backend, then the least write permission should be **writable by the Application Administrator**. If the field is part of the Group Profile, its least read permission should be **readable by anyone, including non-members**.

If the value to be stored is a number, we recommend that C and C++ developers store it as a string instead of binary data. For example, when the number to be stored is 1, store it as string `1` instead of binary data `0x01`. In the future, Chat will offer more operations for custom fields, such as specific mathematical operations on values, which will be performed on the basis of string-type numbers.

### Configuration

Custom fields at these two levels can be configured in the Instant Messaging Chat console.

To configure member-level custom fields, you need to specify the group type first. AVChatRoom and custom group types that are configured based on it do not support custom fields at the group member level, because these types of groups do not store member profiles.

The **self read and write permissions** indicate whether members can read and write their own member-level custom fields. For example, a member-level custom field named `MemberLevel` represents the level of a member in a group. Group members can read but not modify their own levels, and therefore their **self read and write permissions** are set to **readable/unwritable** for this field.

> **Note:**Configured custom fields cannot be deleted or modified. Proceed with caution.

## Custom Callbacks

Third-party callback is an important means to meet the special requirements of apps. It provides users with the capability to customize actions.

Instant Messaging Chat's group system supports different webhooks. For more information, see [Third-Party Webhook Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354) and [Webhook Command List](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34355).
