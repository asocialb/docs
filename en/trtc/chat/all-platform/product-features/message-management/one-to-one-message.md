#### Offline cache and roaming of C2C messages:

1. User A calls `sendMessage` to send messages to user B who is offline.
- User A is added to user Bâs recent contacts, with up to 100 messages cached.
- Messages are stored in the offline cache for 7 days.
- Messages are stored on the roaming server for 7 days.
2. User B calls the `login` API to log in to Chat.
3. The SDK automatically pulls messages from the offline cache and delivers via the `OnNewMessage` callback.
4. The SDK automatically pulls recent contacts and delivers via the `OnNewMessage` callback.
5. The user is notified via the `OnRefresh` callback when message synchronization is completed.
6. The user calls `getMessage`. If local messages are incomplete, the SDK automatically pulls them from the roaming server.
