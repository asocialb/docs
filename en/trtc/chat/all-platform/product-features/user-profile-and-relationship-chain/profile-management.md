## Profile Fields

A profile is a set of data that describes user properties. Chat's profile system supports standard and custom profile fields. Profile fields have the following characteristics:

- Profile fields are expressed in key-value format.
- Key is in string format, and its name can only contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.
- Value has the following types:
 a. An integer of uint32_t type (not supported for custom fields)
 b. An integer of uint64_t type (not supported for custom fields)
 c. A string of string type (the length of the string cannot exceed 500 bytes.)

## Standard Profile Fields

Currently, Chat supports the following standard profile fields:

| Field Name | Type | Description | Push Notification upon Update | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Tag_Profile_IM_Location | string | Location | Yes | The maximum length is 16 bytes. Recommended usage:The app locally defines a set of number-location mappings.The backend stores four uint32_t numbers.The first uint32_t denotes the country or region.The second uint32_t denotes the state or province.The third uint32_t denotes the city.The fourth uint32_t denotes the district or county. |
| Tag_Profile_IM_SelfSignature | string | Personal signature | Yes | The maximum length is 500 bytes. |

AllowType_Type_AllowAny: automatically accept all new friend requests.                    AllowType_Type_DenyAny: reject all new friend requests. |
| Tag_Profile_IM_Language | uint32 | Language | Yes | The application locally defines the number-language mapping and needs to locally convert the number corresponding to the language into text. |

| Tag_Profile_IM_AdminForbidType | string | Admin forbids tagging new friend requests | Yes | AdminForbid_Type_None: the default value, and sending new friend requests is allowed.                    AdminForbid_Type_SendOut: sending new friend requests is forbidden. |
| Tag_Profile_IM_Level | uint32 | Level | Yes | Generally, a piece of UINT-8 data stores the information of one level.You can divide the level to store the level information of multiple roles. |
| Tag_Profile_IM_Language | uint32 | Role | Yes | Generally, a piece of UINT-8 data stores the information of one role.You can divide the role to store the information of multiple roles. |

## Custom Profile Fields

Custom profile fields are the user data set by each app according to its own business needs. By using custom profile fields, an app can add additional data to user profiles and perform read and write operations through existing APIs.

### Applying for custom profile fields

To apply for custom profile fields, log in to the [Chat console](https://console.trtc.io/) and select **Application Configuration** > **Feature Configuration**. After your application is submitted, the custom profile fields will take effect in five minutes.
When applying for custom profile fields, you need to submit the following information for each field:

- The name of the custom profile field (Key). For more information, see [Naming Rules for Custom Profile Fields](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/33520#naming-rules-for-custom-profile-fields).
- The type of the custom profile field (Value). For more information, see [Profile Fields](#.E8.B5.84.E6.96.99.E5.AD.97.E6.AE.B5).

### Naming rules for custom profile fields

The rules for naming custom profile fields are as follows:

- The name of the custom profile field contains the prefix and keyword parts.
- The prefix of the custom profile field is Tag_Profile_Custom.
- Keyword: the keyword must be a string of letters with a length no more than 8 bytes. We recommend you use an English word or its abbreviation as the keyword.
- Example: if the custom field to be applied for by an app has the keyword **Test**, then the name of the custom profile field is: Tag_Profile_Custom_Test.
