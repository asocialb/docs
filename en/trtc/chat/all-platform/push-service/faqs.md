# FAQS

## Android

### How do I troubleshoot if I cannot receive offline push messages?

#### 1.Special Situation Investigation

- **OPPO devices**

There are several common reasons why OPPO devices do not receive push notifications:

  - According to the requirements of the official OPPO Push website, ChannelID must be configured on OPPO devices running Android 8.0 or above, otherwise, push notifications cannot be displayed. For the method of configuration, refer to [setAndroidOPPOChannelID](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/classcom_1_1tencent_1_1imsdk_1_1v2_1_1V2TIMOfflinePushInfo.html#a32d340e95395bb64cc3e8f62321aafe1).
  - The notification bar display feature is disabled by default for applications installed on the OPPO device. If this is the case, check the switch status.
- **Google FCM**

If push notifications are not received, verify whether the certificates have been correctly uploaded to the Chat console. For the troubleshooting path, see the document [Manufacturer Channel](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/60547#f46935b3-9a23-4257-ba0d-20b9a9bda466) > Google FCM, and check against the diagram to see if it has been added correctly.

- **Xiaomi and vivo**

Xiaomi and vivo: The app needs to be listed in the App Marketplace before it can be delivered through the Manufacturer Channel. It is usually indicated that the app is in the blocklist, prohibiting message sending. Or, the App has closed the push channel.

- **Sending custom messages**

The offline push for custom messages differs from that of regular messages. We cannot parse the content of custom messages, thus we cannot determine the content to push; hence, by default, they are not pushed. If you have push requirements, you need to set the [sendMessage](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/classcom_1_1tencent_1_1imsdk_1_1v2_1_1V2TIMMessageManager.html#a28e01403acd422e53e999f21ec064795)'s [desc](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/classcom_1_1tencent_1_1imsdk_1_1v2_1_1V2TIMOfflinePushInfo.html#a78c8e202aa4e0859468ce40bde6fd602) field for offlinePushInfo. The desc information will be displayed by default during the push.

- **Notification bar settings of the device**

The immediate effect of offline push is the Notification Bar Prompt, so like other notifications, it's affected by the device notification settings. Taking Huawei as an example:

  - **Phone Settings** > **Notifications** > **Lock Screen Notifications** > **Hide or Do Not Display Notifications**, will affect the display of offline push notifications when the screen is locked.
  - **Phone Settings** > **Notifications** > **More Notification Settings** > **Status Bar Notification Icons**, will affect the display of offline push notification icons in the status bar.
  - **Phone Settings** > **Notifications** > **App Notification Management** > **Allow Notifications**, toggling on or off will directly affect the display of offline push notifications.
  - **Phone Settings** > **Notifications** > **App Notification Management** > **Notification Ringtone** and **Phone Settings** > **Notifications** > **App Notification Management** > **Silent Notifications**, will affect the sound of offline push notification.
- **Message Classification**

Vendor push services all have message categorization mechanisms, and different types will have different push strategies. For details, please see [Push Message Categorization](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/60576).

- **Vendor Features**

Offline push depends on the vendor's capabilities, and some simple characters may be filtered by the vendor and not be pushed through transparently. It is recommended to use meaningful content for pushing.

#### 2.Self-service Push Troubleshooting Tool

- **Whether the device push plugin access is normal**

Test whether messages can be properly pushed offline by using the [Offline Testing Tool](https://console.trtc.io/chat/push-plugin-push-check) in the Chat Console.

- **Push Link Troubleshooting**

Use the [Troubleshooting Tool](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/60541) to view the details of the full push link.

### How to troubleshoot if the jump interface is unsuccessful?

#### 1.Click to Jump to Configuration Check

See [Customizable Click-through Redirect](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/60575) for detailed inspection:

- Configure the subsequent actions after clicking in the console as follows, select **Open the specified interface within the app**, plugin users will by default fill in the jump parameters, check if the parameters have been modified.
- Registration and callback processing for click events. It is recommended to register during the application Application's oncreate() function, which needs to be placed early in the application lifecycle.
- Check if the click callback correctly handles the redirect logic.

#### 2.Device System Permission Restrictions

If the application process does not exist and clicking the notification bar to jump to the application interface, it is necessary to pull the application from the background to the foreground. Some manufacturers' systems will check whether the App has enabled **background self-start** or **floating window** permissions. If not enabled, the system side will intercept and handle it, leading to failure.

Different manufacturers, and even different Android versions from the same manufacturer, offer different permissions and permission names for applications. Through testing, only the background pop-up interface permission needs to be enabled for Mi 6, while Redmi requires both the background pop-up interface and floating window display permissions, necessitating different treatments for different manufacturers.

### Overseas Push Guide

1. The manufacturers supported for overseas offline push are FCM, Huawei, OPPO and APNS.
2. Essential and sufficient conditions for the FCM channel: The device can access overseas websites, the device has installed and supports GMS service, and TIMPush is successfully integrated. Note: Most domestic devices do not have GMS service installed and cannot support FCM push.

### FCM push issue

1. If you want to prioritize the FCM channel, please use the interface [forceUseFCMPushChannel](https://trtc.io/document/60557?platform=web&product=chat&menulabel=uikit#forceUseFCMPushChannel).
2. FCM push messages may start the application process. Please do not log in, report data, or perform other logic that is not suitable for high-frequency concurrency during the application startup, i.e., the onCreate() declaration cycle of the application.

### Others

##### Is it supported to push to Samsung, ZTE, Transsion, Nut, Hisense, Sony, etc., mobile phones?

Online push supports all models, including Samsung, ZTE, Transsion, Nut, Hisense, Sony, and more.

##### Huawei

- Huawei Push Certificate ID <= 11344, using Huawei Push v2 Version Interface, does not support reach and click acknowledgment. If you need statistical data feature, please regenerate and update the Certificate ID.
- AndroidInfo.ExtAsHuaweiIntentParam, passing "1" means treating the pass-through content Ext as an Intent parameter, "0" means treating the pass-through content Ext as an Action parameter. The restapi using "1" currently does not support click event statistics.

##### Statistical Data Feature

Only the push data details of the last device logged in are recorded; multi-platform login scenarios are not supported.

##### The Debug version of the App feature works normally, but anomalies occur with the Release version of the App feature

This issue is very likely caused by obfuscation. You can add the following obfuscation rules:

```
-keep class com.tencent.qcloud.** { *; }-keep class com.tencent.timpush.** { *; }
```

##### Resolving conflicts between integrating TIMPush and other competitors

The reason is that the application itself or the third-party push client it integrates or depends on conflicts with the third-party client in TIMPush. It is necessary to keep only one in use. For specific methods, please refer to: [TIMPush Integration Conflict Resolution](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/60577#).

### Push can only receive two or several messages, testing tool displays sent successfully, then fails to be delivered, what is the issue?

It is likely that the message type is categorized as marketing by default by the manufacturer, limiting the number of sent messages per day. You can apply and adapt according to the [Message Categorization Summary Document](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/60576).

> **Note:**Message categorization may not be the same as each manufacturer, some require applying for enabling, and specific manufacturers take effect after a certain time when the application is submitted.Message classification field: Normally the console cert webpage can fill in default values, such as category. The RestAPI and client API also provide corresponding fields or methods to override the console default values, achieving the effect of multiple classifications.

### TIMPush integration: receiving push notifications offline but failed to get TIMPushListener.OnRecvPushMessage push callback online, why?

The Chat SDK version should be consistent with the TIMPush Plugin version.

### TIMPush Plugin integration, OPPO models, not receiving push notifications when content of messages sent Is too long?

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/2e2f495ab92311f09a6b525400454e06.png)

Vendor Push has a length limit for desc push content. You can set `V2TIMOfflinePushInfo.desc` content not more than the length limit in `sendMessage`.

### TIMPush Plugin integration, OPPO models, unable to receive message push after registration is successful through client sendmessage however push received via RestAPI?

This issue is generally caused by customers setting the **push click event** to "navigate to specified page" in the IM Console Configuration but filling in an incorrect custom path. It is recommended to use the default path of the IM component.

### TIMPush integration, compile and run error about `"com.Huawei.Agconnect"`, complete error as follows:

`Caused by: org.gradle.api.internal.plugins.PluginApplicationException: Failed to apply plugin 'com.huawei.agconnect'.`

`at org.gradle.api.internal.plugins.DefaultPluginManager.doApply(DefaultPluginManager.java:173)`

`at org.gradle.api.internal.plugins.DefaultPluginManager.apply(DefaultPluginManager.java:146)`

**Solution:**

`classpath 'com.huawei.agconnect:agcp:1.6.0.300'` Replace with: `classpath 'com.huawei.agconnect:agcp:1.9.1.301'`.

### Client access push plugin, online push failed to be delivered, offline push received, what is the issue?

Confirm the following points:

- Whether the switch is on (corresponding to [disablePostNotificationInForeground](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/67571) API calls).

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/2e260523b92311f0b0cf525400e889b2.png)

- Whether the sender message contains valid `offlinePushInfo`, `title` should not be empty, and `disablePush` is `false`.
- Recipient is in the foreground.

## iOS

### Why doesn't offline push work for common messages?

- First, check that the app runtime environment is the same as the certificate environment. Otherwise, offline push messages will not be received.
- Next, check if the app and the certificate environment are set to production. If they are in a development environment, applying for a `deviceToken` from Apple might fail. This issue has not been found in the production environment, so please switch to production for testing.

### Why doesn't offline push work for custom messages?

The offline push for custom messages differs from that for regular messages. We cannot parse the content of custom messages, making it impossible to determine the push content. Therefore, custom messages are not pushed by default. If you require push, you need to set the [offlinePushInfo](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/interfaceV2TIMOfflinePushInfo.html) `desc` field during [sendMessage](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/categoryV2TIMManager_07Message_08.html#a681947465d6ab718da40f7f983740a21). The `desc` information will by default be displayed during push.

### How do I disable the receiving of offline push messages?

To disable receiving offline push messages, you can set the `config` parameter of the [setAPNS](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/categoryV2TIMManager_07APNS_08.html#a73bf19c0c019e5e27ec441bc753daa9e) API to `nil`. This feature has been supported starting from version 5.6.1200.

### Push notifications are not received, and the server reports a 'bad devicetoken'.

Apple's deviceToken is related to the current compilation environment, please check:

1. In the access process, check if the businessID of [Configure Push Parameters](https://www.tencentcloud.com/zh/document/product/1047/60553#368255ad-5a6b-49c2-a57f-cf452abafebb) matches the certificate ID for the corresponding environment.
2. Console create certificate check:

Production Environment Certificate: The type of certificate uploaded is Apple Push Notification service SSL (Sandbox & Production), and it should be tested after creating the release package in Archive. Note: Do not test in Xcode.

Development Environment Certificate: You need to test after creating the release package in Archive, just select the correct certificate.

### iOS Registration Error: "ErrCode": 3000, "ErrMsg": "Entitlement String 'Aps-Environment' for the App Not Found"

- Reason 1: Push notification permission is not enabled in the Xcode project. Check Xcode configuration. Enablement method: [Add push permission in Xcode](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/60548#dba3c9f6-3b76-4db0-aa3e-35ddb1337d6b).

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/4959e2e5920311f0bdaa525400bf7822.png)

- Reason 2: Under the AppleID account to which the app belongs, Push Notifications is not checked to enable Remote Push Service for the corresponding application. You can check whether the description file contains "aps-environment" and whether it corresponds to the correct development/production environment. Enablement method: [Apply for APNs certificate](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/60548#3c034368-0da8-42d2-a8c9-c84f37454828).

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/49574f36920311f089d25254007c27c5.png)

### Under the iOS development environment, is the registration occasionally not returning a deviceToken or indicating a failure in requesting the token from APNs?

This problem is caused by instability of APNs. You can fix it in the following ways:

1. Insert a SIM card into the phone and use the 4G network.
2. Uninstall and reinstall the application, restart the application, or shut down and restart the phone.
3. Use a package for the production environment.
4. Use another iPhone.

### iOS did not receive the delivery receipt

1. To report push delivery data, enable the console switch to support iOS 10's Extension feature. For more details, please refer to [Statistics Push Arrival Rate](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/60553#a76b331f-3d49-48c9-99a9-5301c7d7fa99).
2. To ensure reported data is not lost in abnormal conditions, iOS push data reporting will only occur upon the next log in, which may result in a delay. Please try to log in again.

### iOS Certificate Expiration

In the Chat console, click editing on the corresponding certificate and update the p12 certificate. It's important to note: do not delete the certificate and recreate it, as recreating the certificate will change the certificate ID, and an update will be required to support it.

### iOS Statistical Reporting Feature

To report push reach data, this switch must be enabled to support iOS 10's Extension feature. For more details, please refer to [Statistics Push Arrival Rate](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/60553#a76b331f-3d49-48c9-99a9-5301c7d7fa99).

### Differences Among APNS, VOIP and LiveActivity

### iOS access failed, console testing tool returns token and cert mismatch?

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/640b06e8b94511f09a6b525400454e06.png)

The iOS push certificate is divided into the official environment and test environment. The Token is also separated by environment. The Token and certificate must correspond for push to work.

1. Token is official or test depending on client packaging. Confirm whether the environment is normal:
  - Development environment (Xcode run directly), configure the uploaded certificate ID through Debug settings.
  - Production environment (packaged ipa), configure the uploaded certificate ID in release settings.

Most customers often upload production certificates to the development environment.

2. You can choose a development/production certificate as a bundle or use a p8 cert. Upload to the Chat console and select the desired environment.

### Admin sent account failed to be delivered `onRecvPushMessage`, (BOOL)onRemoteNotificationReceived:(nullable NSString *)notice this method execution executed, however notice is empty string, how to handle?

Check if the customer's server API has set `OfflinePushInfo`. Recommend setting it up and try the Ext field corresponding to `onRemoteNotificationReceived`.

### Error: dyld: Library Not Loaded: @rpath/ImSDK_Plus.framework/ImSDK_Plus, Referenced From: /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/52F5B9F2-435F-4BBF-BF7D-3EC3B381CE80/Demo.app/Frameworks/TIMPush.framework/TIMPush, Reason: image not found?

Caused by lack of Chat SDK. Execute first pod 'TXIMSDK_Plus_iOS' or pod 'TXIMSDK_Plus_iOS_XCFramework', then rerun pod install.

### APNs push, manufacturer returns error code info code: 403, reason: InvalidProviderToken?

The customer used a P8 certificate, but the reported Token and certificate mismatched, causing verification failure by the manufacturer.

Pay attention to the following points:

1. When the client generates the regId, the bundleId used must match the bundleId used for server push.
2. Ensure teamId and keyId are filled in accurately.
3. Use the correct certificate (check whether the certificate is for production environment or testing environment).

### Reach statistics with delay?

Android reach reporting is returned by the manufacturer, while iOS reach reporting is submitted by the client. Therefore, when Android reaches depends on the manufacturer and is not controlled by Chat. iOS reach reporting has a delay and will be reported the next time the client logs in.

## Flutter

### Flutter side: `tencent_cloud_chat_push` push plugin upgrade to version 8.1, http call to `registerPush` API for push registration causes kickoff, affecting use, how to handle?

Issue as shown in the figure below.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/63efed79b94511f0b9945254005ef0f7.png)

Reason:

- For customers using Chat capacity + Vendor Push, when making a `registerPush` call to register for push services, the AppID and AppKey are not required (otherwise the plug-in's login-free logic will be enabled).
- This issue appears in the xlog as a login call during register for push services, with a UserID different from the already logged in UserID.
- In the xlog, the account_type corresponding to the **login account** is Push.

Correct call:

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/6412e19fb94511f0a6c652540044a08e.png)

### After configuring FCM push notifications, when testing with an OPPO device, since the plug-in internally defaults to the OPPO channel, it causes "OPPO push registration failed" during push service registration. How to resolve?

Call `setPushBrandId` prior to register for push services and designate the FCM channel to resolve this.

### Registering FCM push reports "Default FirebaseApp is not initialized in this process com.tencent.flutter.tuikit. Make sure to call FirebaseApp.initializeApp(Context) first." error, How to resolve?

**Reason:** Version incompatibility of the "com.google.gms:google-services" Google GMS service Plugin caused this.

**Solution:** Modify the gms Plugin version to 4.3.15.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/63f60dcfb94511f0b4c35254001c06ec.png)

### Flutter tencent_cloud_chat_push plug-in integration, click to push notification, do not trigger the "onNotificationClicked" callback, logs are as follows:

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/63f63087b94511f0a5e052540099c741.png)

1. Start by checking if push notifications are received, which confirms the Push Configuration is correct.
2. Possible reasons might be:
  - Customers use hybrid development, which leads to native end push registration due to multi-process.
  - Push click method in IM Console Configuration is not "specified page".
  - Push redirection method in IM Console Configuration, path filled in specified page is not "Plugin default path".

### TUICallKit + TIMPush integration, switching to background to receive call invitation, clicking push notification, app does not navigate to "call invitation interface", how to resolve?

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/640e7c0bb94511f0a5e052540099c741.png)

1. The customer needs to check: what is the "click subsequent actions" configured in the IM Console, select "open a specified page within the app". Plugin integration has a default value, just use the default value.
2. Add the "auto login" logic in the `onNotificationClicked` Webhook of the Push Plugin.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/640b44d4b94511f0a6c652540044a08e.png)

## Others

#### Cannot Receive Push Notifications, Plugin Subscription Expired

Once the push plugin's **trial or purchase expires, the push service will automatically stop (including standard message offline push, broadcast/Tag push, etc.)**. To avoid affecting the normal use of your business, please [purchase](https://buy.tencentcloud.com/avc?activeId=plugin&regionId=1)/[renew](https://console.tencentcloud.com/account/renewal) in advance.
