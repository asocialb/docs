# All Users / Tags / UserID Push Callback

#### Feature Description

After enabling the push plugin, the push results can be forwarded to the app backend by configuring the basic callback.

#### Notes

- This callback belongs to the event callback after downstream diffusion. To prevent a large number of callback requests from overwhelming the App backend, **default QPS: 1000 times/s**. Overfrequency callbacks will be retried after a delay. If you need to adjust QPS due to business requirements, you can submit a [ticket](https://trtc.io/zh/login/redirect?s_url=https://console.tencentcloud.com/workorder/category) to apply.
- To enable this callback, you must configure the callback URL and enable the corresponding switch for this callback. For more information on the configuration method, see the [Webhooks](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520) documentation.
- During this callback, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.
- For additional safety-related concerns, please refer to the [Third-Party Callback Overview: Security Considerations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354) document.

### API Description

#### Request URL sample:

In the following example, the callback URL configured in the App configuration is `https://www.example.com`

Example:

```
https://www.example.com?SdkAppid=$SDKAppID&CallbackCommand=$CallbackCommand&contenttype=json
```

#### Request parameters

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| https | Request protocol is HTTPSRequest method is POST |
| www.example.com | Callback URL |
| SdkAppid | SDKAppID allocated by the Instant Messaging console at the time of Application creation |
| CallbackCommand | Fixed as: Push.AllMemberPush |
| contenttype | The request payload is fixed as JSON |
