# Callback After Sending a One-to-One Message to a Chatbot

## Feature Description

The App backend can perform real-time operations on one-to-one messages by using this callback, including:

- Perform real-time logging on one-to-one messages (for example, log recording or message synchronization to other systems).
- Perform data statistics on one-to-one messages (for example, statistics on the number of participants or messages).

## Must-Knows

- To enable the callback, you need to configure the callback URL and turn on the switch corresponding to this callback. For the configuration method, see [Webhook Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34520#).
- The direction of the callback is that the Chat backend sends HTTPS POST requests to the App backend.
- After receiving a callback request, the App backend needs to verify whether the value of the SDKAppID parameter in the request URL is its own SDKAppID.
- If both the callbacks before sending a one-to-one message and after sending a one-to-one message are enabled at the same time and the callback before sending a one-to-one message returns the error code indicating speaking is prohibited, the callback after sending a one-to-one message will not be triggered.
- If both the callbacks before sending a one-to-one message and after sending a one-to-one message are enabled at the same time and the message body is changed for the callback before sending a one-to-one message, the changed message will be used to trigger the callback after sending a one-to-one message.
- For other security-related matters, see Security Considerations in [Webhook Overview](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354#security-considerations).

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

- An App user sends a one-to-one message through the client, and the recipient is a chatbot.
- An App administrator sends a one-to-one message through a REST API (sendmsg), and the recipient is a chatbot.

## Callback Triggering Timing

The callback is triggered after the Chat backend receives a one-to-one message sent by a user and sends the message to the target user. The target user is identified as a chatbot.

## API Description

### Sample Request URL

In the following example, the callback URL configured for the App is `https://www.example.com`.

**Example:**

```
https://www.example.com?SdkAppid=$SDKAppID&CallbackCommand=$CallbackCommand&contenttype=json&ClientIP=$ClientIP&OptPlatform=$OptPlatform
```

### Request Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| https | The request protocol is HTTPS, and the request method is POST. |
| www.example.com | Callback URL. |
| SdkAppid | SDKAppID assigned to an application when the application is created in the Chat console. |
| CallbackCommand | The value is fixed as Bot.OnC2CMessage. |
| contenttype | The value is fixed as json. |
| ClientIP | Client IP address. For example, 127.0.0.1. |
| OptPlatform | Client platform. For the valid values, see the description of the OptPlatform parameter in Webhook Protocol on [Webhook Overview](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354#webhook-protocol). |

### Sample Request Packet

```
{    "CallbackCommand": "Bot.OnC2CMessage", // Callback command.    "From_Account": "jared", // Sender.    "To_Account": "Jonh", // Recipient.    "MsgSeq": 48374, // Message serial number.    "MsgRandom": 2837546, // Message random number.    "MsgTime": 1557481126, // Message sending timestamp, in seconds.     "MsgKey": "48374_2837546_1557481126", // Unique message identifier, which can be used for recalling a one-to-one message by calling a REST API.    "OnlineOnlyFlag":1,//Flag indicating whether to send the message only to online users. 1: send only to online users; 0: send to all users.    "SendMsgResult": 0, // Message sending result.    "ErrorInfo": "send msg succeed", // Error message returned when message sending fails. If the message is sent successfully, "send msg succeed" is returned.    "MsgBody": [ // Message body.        {            "MsgType": "TIMTextElem", // Text.            "MsgContent": {                "Text": "red packet"            }        }    ],    "CloudCustomData": "your cloud custom data",    "EventTime": 1670574414123 // Event trigger timestamp, in milliseconds.}
```

### Request Packet Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CallbackCommand | String | Callback command. |
| From_Account | String | User ID of the message sender. |
| To_Account | String | User ID of the message recipient. |
| MsgSeq | Integer | Message serial number (a 32-bit unsigned integer), which is used to identify the message. |
| MsgRandom | Integer | Message random number (a 32-bit unsigned integer), which is used to identify the message. |
| MsgTime | Integer | Message sending timestamp, in seconds.MsgTime is preferentially used for sorting one-to-one messages. For messages sent in the same second, MsgSeq is used for sorting. A message is sent more recently if its MsgSeq value is larger. |
| MsgKey | String | Unique identifier of the message, which can be used for [withdrawing a one-to-one message by calling a REST API](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/35015#). |
| OnlineOnlyFlag | Integer | Flag indicating whether to send the message only to online users. 1: send only to online users; 0: send to all users. |
| SendMsgResult | Integer | Sending result of the message. 0: sending successful; other values: sending failed. See [Error Codes](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34348#message-error-codes2) for details. |
| ErrorInfo | String | Error message returned when message sending fails. If the message is sent successfully, "send msg succeed" is returned. |
| MsgBody | Array | Message body. See [Message Formats](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/33527#) for details. |
| CloudCustomData | String | Custom message data. (It is saved on the cloud and will be sent to the recipient. It can still be obtained after Chat is uninstalled and then reinstalled.) |
| EventTime | Integer | Event trigger timestamp, in milliseconds. |

### Sample Response Packet

The response packet is returned after the App backend synchronizes the data.

```
{    "ActionStatus": "OK",    "ErrorInfo": "",    "ErrorCode": 0 // 0: callback successful; 1: callback error.}
```

### Response Packet Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ActionStatus | String | Required | Request processing result:OK: processing successful.FAIL: processing failed. |
| ErrorCode | Integer | Required | Error Code:0: callback successful.1: callback error. |
| ErrorInfo | String | Required | Error message. |
