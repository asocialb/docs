# After a User Is Followed

## Feature Description

The App backend can view the user's newly-added attention information in real time.

## Notes

- To enable this webhook, you must configure the webhook URL and enable the corresponding switch for this webhook. For more information on the configuration method, see [Webhook Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this webhook, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the webhook request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is the SDKAppID of the app.
