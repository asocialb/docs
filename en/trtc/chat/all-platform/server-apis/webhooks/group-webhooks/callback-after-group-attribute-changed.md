# Callback After Group Attribute Changed

## Feature Overview

The App Backend can use this callback to view real-time information on Group Custom Definition Attribute changes, including: modification, clearing, resetting, and deletion of Group Custom Definition Attributes. The App Backend can use this callback for operations such as data synchronization.

## Notes

- To enable the callback, you must configure a callback URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol switch. For detailed configuration methods, see [Third-party Callback Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34520) document.
- During this callback, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.
- For other security-related matters, please refer to [Introduction to Third-party Callback - Security Considerations](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354#.E5.AE.89.E5.85.A8.E8.80.83.E8.99.91).

## Scenarios that may trigger this callback

- App users modify, clear, reset, delete Group Custom Definition Attributes through the client.
- App administrators modify, clear, reset, delete Group Custom Definition Attributes via RESTful APIs.

## Callback Trigger Time

After the change of Group Custom Definition Attributes.

## API description

### Sample request URL

In the subsequent example, the callback URL configured within the app is `https://www.example.com`.
**Example:**

```
https://www.example.com?SdkAppid=$SDKAppID&CallbackCommand=$CallbackCommand&contenttype=json&ClientIP=$ClientIP&OptPlatform=$OptPlatform
```

### Request parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| https | The request protocol is HTTPS, and the request method is POST |
| www.example.com | Callback URL |
| SdkAppid | SDKAppID allocated by the Instant Messaging console at the time of Application creation |
| CallbackCommand | Set to Group.CallbackAfterGroupAttrChanged |
| contenttype | Fixed value: JSON |
| ClientIP | Client IP, such as 127.0.0.1 |
| OptPlatform | Client Platform, see the meaning of the OptPlatform parameter in [Third-Party Callback Introduction - Callback Protocol](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354#.E5.9B.9E.E8.B0.83.E5.8D.8F.E8.AE.AE) |

### Sample request packets

```
{    "CallbackCommand": "Group.CallbackAfterGroupAttrChanged",    "GroupId": "@TGS#2J4SZEAEL",    "Type": "Public",    "Operator_Account": "leckie",    "OptionType":"set",   // "set": Reset the attribute defined by the user; "modify": Modify the attribute defined by the user;  "clear": Clear the attribute defined by the user;  "delete": Delete the attribute defined by the user    "GroupAttr": [        {            "key": "key1",            "value": "value1"        },        {            "key": "key2",            "value": "values"        }    ],    "EventTime":"1670574414123"// Event trigger timestamp in milliseconds		}
```

### Request packet fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CallbackCommand | String | Callback command |
| GroupId | String | Operating Group ID |
| Type | String | Group Type [Group Type Introduction](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/33529#GroupType), e.g., Public |
| Operator_Account | String | UserID of the operator initiating the request to change the group's user-defined attributes |
| GroupAttr | Array | Custom Attribute List, where key is the name of the user-defined attribute, and value is the value of the user-defined attribute |
| EventTime | Integer | Event trigger timestamp in milliseconds |

### Response packet example

Following data synchronization, the app backend dispatches a callback response packet.

```
{    "ActionStatus": "OK",    "ErrorInfo": "",    "ErrorCode": 0 // Ignore callback result}
```

### Response packet field description

| Field | Type | Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ActionStatus | String | Mandatory | Processed Request Result:OK: Indicates successful processingFAIL: Indicates failure |
| ErrorCode | Integer | Mandatory | Error Code, entering 0 here means to ignore the response result |
| ErrorInfo | String | Mandatory | Error message |
