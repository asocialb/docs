# Callback After Read Receipt

## Feature Overview

The App Backend can use this callback to view the status of group message read receipts in real-time, and accordingly, perform operations such as data synchronization.

## Notes

- To enable the callback, you must configure a callback URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol switch. For detailed configuration methods, see [Third-party Callback Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34520) document.
- During this callback, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.
- For other security-related matters, please refer to the [Webhook Overview - Security Considerations](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354#.E5.AE.89.E5.85.A8.E8.80.83.E8.99.91) document.

## Scenarios that may trigger this callback

- An App user sends a read receipt message through the client.
- An App user acknowledges group message read receipts through the client.
- The App administrator sends a read receipt message via RESTful APIs.

## Callback Trigger Time

Send a read receipt message or acknowledge a message as read.

## API description

### Sample request URL

In the subsequent example, the callback URL configured within the app is `https://www.example.com`.

```

### Request parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| https | The request protocol is HTTPS, and the request method is POST |
| www.example.com | Callback URL |
| SdkAppid | SDKAppID allocated by the Instant Messaging console at the time of Application creation |
| CallbackCommand | Fixed to Group.CallbackAfterReadReceipt |
| contenttype | Fixed value: JSON |
| ClientIP | Client IP, such as 127.0.0.1 |
| OptPlatform | Client platform, see the meaning of OptPlatform in [Webhook Overview: Callback Protocol](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354#.E5.9B.9E.E8.B0.83.E5.8D.8F.E8.AE.AE) |

### Sample request packets

```
{    "CallbackCommand": "Group.CallbackAfterReadReceipt",    // Callback after read receipt    "GroupId": "@TGS#2TTV7VSII", // Group ID    "Type": "Public", // Group Type    "GroupMsgReceiptList": [   // Read Receipt Information      {          "MsgSeq": 1,                 "ReadNum": 1,      // Group message read count          "UnreadNum": 6     // Group message unread count          "ReadReceiptMembers":[              {                  "Member_Account":"user0"              }          ]      },      {          "MsgSeq": 2,          "ReadNum": 1,          "UnreadNum": 6,          "ReadReceiptMembers":[              {                  "Member_Account":"user0"              }          ]      }    ],    "EventTime":"1670574414123"// Event trigger timestamp in milliseconds}
```

### Request packet fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CallbackCommand | String | Callback command |
| GroupId | String | Operating Group ID |
| Type | String | Group Type (Community not supported for now) [Group Type Introduction](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/33529#GroupType), for example, Public |
| GroupMsgReceiptList | Array | Read Receipt Information |
| MsgSeq | Integer | Message Seq |
| ReadNum | Integer | Number of Read Members |
| UnreadNum | Integer | Number of Unread Members |
| ReadReceiptMembers | Array | List of Read Members, Member_Account is the UserID of members who have read |
| EventTime | Integer | Event trigger timestamp in milliseconds |

### Response packet example

Following data synchronization, the app backend dispatches a callback response packet.

```
{    "ActionStatus": "OK",    "ErrorInfo": "",    "ErrorCode": 0 // Ignore callback result}
```

### Response packet field description

| Field | Type | Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ActionStatus | String | Mandatory | Processed Request Result:OK: Indicates successful processingFAIL: Indicates failure |
| ErrorCode | Integer | Mandatory | Error Code, entering 0 here means to ignore the response result |
| ErrorInfo | String | Mandatory | Error message |
