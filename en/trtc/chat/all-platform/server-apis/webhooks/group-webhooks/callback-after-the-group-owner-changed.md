# Callback After the Group Owner Changed

## Feature Overview

The app backend can use this callback to view group owner change information in real-time. The app backend can perform operations such as data synchronization based on this callback.

## Notes

- To enable the callback, you must configure a callback URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol switch. For detailed configuration methods, see [Third-party Callback Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34520) document.
- During this callback, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.
- For other security-related matters, please refer to the [Webhook Overview - Security Considerations](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354#.E5.AE.89.E5.85.A8.E8.80.83.E8.99.91) document.

## Scenarios that may trigger this callback

- An app user successfully transfers the group owner via the client.
- The app administrator successfully transfers the group owner via the REST API.

## Callback Trigger Time

After Successfully Transferring the Group Owner.
