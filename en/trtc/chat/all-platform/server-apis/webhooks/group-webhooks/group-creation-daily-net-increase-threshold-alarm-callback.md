# Group Creation Daily Net Increase Threshold Alarm Callback

## Feature Overview

The application backend can receive group daily net increase limit threshold warnings through this callback.

## Notes

- To enable this callback, you must configure the URL. This callback and the callback after group profile modification use the same switch. For detailed directions, see [Webhook Configuration](https://trtc.io/document/34520).
- During this callback, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the `SDKAppID` contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For more security considerations, see the **Security Considerations** section in [Third-Party Callback Overview](https://trtc.io/document/34354).
- You need to [enable the topic feature in the console](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34419) before using it.

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

- An App user creates a group through the client, and the daily group increment (the number of groups created minus the number of groups dissolved) exceeds 70% of the limit.
- An App administrator creates a group through the REST API, and the daily group increment (the number of groups created minus the number of groups dissolved) exceed 70% of the limit.

## Callback Triggering Timing

After the creation of the group.
