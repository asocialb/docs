# API Overclocking Alarm Callbacks

#### Feature Overview

When the request frequency of the API exceeds 80% of the threshold, the app backend is notified of the call frequency alarm information through a callback.

#### Notes

- To enable the callback, you must configure the callback URL. For detailed configuration methods, see [Webhook Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- Once the callback URL is configured, an alarm callback is triggered by default if the request frequency exceeds the alarm threshold.
- During this callback, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.
- For other security-related matters, see [Webhook Overview - Security Considerations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354).
