# After a Official Channel Is Created

## Feature Overview

This webhook event allows the app backend to view information related to the creation of official channels by users in real time, including notifying the app backend of the successful creation of an official channel, allowing for data synchronization and other operations.

## Notes

- To enable the webhook, you must configure the webhook URL and enable the corresponding switch for this webhook. For more information on the configuration method, see [Webhook Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this webhook, the Chat Server initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the webhook request, the app server must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is the SDKAppID of the app.
- For additional safety-related concerns, please refer to the [Webhook Overview: Security Considerations](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354) document.
