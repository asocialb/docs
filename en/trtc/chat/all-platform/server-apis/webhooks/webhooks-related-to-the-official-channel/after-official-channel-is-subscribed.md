# After Official Channel Is Subscribed

## Feature Overview

After subscribing to the Official Channel, the app backend can use this webhook to view the subscription messages in real-time, including: Notification to the app backend when a member subscribes to the Official Channel, allowing the app to perform necessary data synchronization.

## Notes

- To enable the webhook, you must configure the Webhook URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For more information on the configuration method, see [Webhook Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this webhook, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the webhook request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For additional safety-related concerns, please refer to the [Webhook Overview: Security Considerations](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354) document.
