# After Official Channel Is Unsubscribed

## Feature Overview

The app backend can use this webhook to view in real time the activity of users unsubscribing from the official channel, including: real-time recording of user unsubscriptions (e.g., logging or synchronization with other systems).

## Notes

- To enable the webhook, you must configure the Webhook URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For more information on the configuration method, see [Webhook Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this webhook, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the webhook request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For additional safety-related concerns, please refer to the [Webhook Overview: Security Considerations](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354) document.

## Webhook Triggering Scenarios

- App users unsubscribe from the official channel through the client.
- App administrators delete subscribers through REST API.

## Webhook Triggering Timing
