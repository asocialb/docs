# After Official Channel Profile Is Modified

## Feature Overview

Through this webhook, the app backend can view changes to Official Channel Information (such as Official Channel Name, Official Channel Description, Official Channel Avatar, etc.) in real time, including realtime records of changes to Official Channel Information (e.g., logging or syncing to other systems).

## Notes

- To enable the webhook, you must configure a webhook URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For more information on the configuration method, see [Webhook Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this webhook, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the webhook request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For other security-related matters, please refer to the [Webhook Introduction: Security Considerations](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354).
