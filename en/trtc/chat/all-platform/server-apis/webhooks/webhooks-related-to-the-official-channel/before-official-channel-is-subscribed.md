# Before Official Channel Is Subscribed

## Feature Overview

This webhook event allows the app backend to check user subscription requests to the Official Channel in real time, including the capability for the backend to intercept such requests.

## Notes

- To enable the webhook, you must configure the Webhook URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For more information on the configuration method, see [Webhook Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this webhook, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the webhook request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For additional safety-related concerns, please refer to the [Webhook Overview: Security Considerations](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354) document.

## Webhook Triggering Scenarios

- App users subscribe to the Official Channel through the client.
- The app admin adds subscribers via the REST API.
