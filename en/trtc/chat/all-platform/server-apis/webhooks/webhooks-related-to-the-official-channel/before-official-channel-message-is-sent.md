# Before Official Channel Message Is Sent

## Feature Overview

This webhook allows the app backend to view the broadcast messages of a official channel in real time, including:

- Records official channel messages in real time, for example, by recording a log or synchronizing the messages to other systems.
- Blocks users' requests to send messages on a official channel.

> **Caution**The pre-message webhook defaults to a 2-second timeout and does not support adjustments. Using this for content review will add two instances of public network transmission, thereby at least doubling the overall latency compared to regular scenarios.

## Notes

- To enable the webhook, you must configure the Webhook URL and activate the switch corresponding to this webhook protocol. For detailed configuration instructions, please refer to the [Webhook Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34520) document.
- During this webhook, the IM backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the webhook request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.
- For additional safety-related concerns, please refer to the [Webhook Overview: Security Considerations](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354) document.

## Webhook Triggering Scenarios

- An app user sends a Official Account Message via the client.
- The app administrator sends a Official Account Message via RESTful APIs.

## Webhook Triggering Timing

The webhook is triggered before the Chat backend sends a Official Account Message to subscribers.

## API Calling Description

### Sample request URL

In the subsequent example, the webhook URL configured within the app is `https://www.example.com`.
**Example:**

```
https://www.example.com?SdkAppid=$SDKAppID&CallbackCommand=$CallbackCommand&contenttype=json&ClientIP=$ClientIP&OptPlatform=$OptPlatform
```

### Request parameters

| Parameter | Description |

| https | The request protocol is HTTPS, and the request method is POST. |
| www.example.com | Webhook URL. |
| SdkAppid | The SDKAppID assigned by the Chat console when an app is created. |
| CallbackCommand | Fixed as OfficialAccount.CallbackBeforeSendMsg. |
| contenttype | Fixed value: JSON. |
| ClientIP | Client IP, such as: 127.0.0.1. |
| OptPlatform | Client Platform, for values please refer to [Webhook Overview: Webhook Protocol](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354) for the meaning of the OptPlatform parameter. |

### Sample request

```
{    "CallbackCommand": "OfficialAccount.CallbackBeforeSendMsg", // Webhook command    "Official_Account": "@TOA#_2J4SZEAEL", // Official Account User ID    "OnlineOnlyFlag": 1, // The value is `1` if it is an online message and `0` if it's not    "MsgBody": [ // Message body, refer to TIMMessage object        {            "MsgType": "TIMTextElem", // Text            "MsgContent": {                "Text": "red packet"            }        }    ],    "CloudCustomData": "your cloud custom data",    "EventTime": 1670574414123 // Event trigger timestamp in milliseconds		}
```

### Request fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CallbackCommand | String | Webhook command. |
| Official_Account | String | Official Account User ID. |
| OnlineOnlyFlag | Integer | Online message, `1` if true, otherwise `0`. |
| MsgBody | Array | Message body, please refer to [Message Formats](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/33527). |
| CloudCustomData | String | Custom message data (stored in the cloud, will be sent to the peer, and can be retrieved even after the app is uninstalled and reinstalled). |
| EventTime | Integer | Event trigger timestamp in milliseconds. |

### Sample response

#### Allow speaking

Allow users to speak, without modifying the content of the message to be sent.

```
{    "ActionStatus": "OK",    "ErrorInfo": "",    "ErrorCode": 0 // 0 means allowed to speak}
```

#### Prohibit speaking

The user is not allowed to speak. Consequently, the message will not be sent, and the error code `10016` is returned to the requester.

```
{    "ActionStatus": "OK",    "ErrorInfo": "",    "ErrorCode": 1 // 1 means speaking is not allowed}
```

#### Silent discard

The user is not allowed to speak. In this case, the message will not be sent, but a success response will be returned to the caller, making them believe that the message has been dispatched.

```
{    "ActionStatus": "OK",    "ErrorInfo": "",    "ErrorCode": 2 // 2 means Silent Discard}
```

#### Change Message Content

In the following response example: The message sent to the official channel is modified (a custom Definition message was added). The Chat backend will send the modified message. Based on this feature, the app backend can add special content, such as user level and title, to the message sent by the user.

```
{    "ActionStatus": "OK",    "ErrorInfo": "",    "ErrorCode": 0, // Must be 0, only then can the modified message be properly dispatched    "MsgBody": [ // Message after App changes; if absent, the user's sent message is the default        {            "MsgType": "TIMTextElem", // Text            "MsgContent": {                "Text": "red packet"            }        },        {            "MsgType": "TIMCustomElem", // Custom message            "MsgContent": {                "Desc": "CustomElement.MemberLevel", // Description                "Data": "LV1" // Data            }        }    ],    "CloudCustomData": "your cloud custom data"}
```

### Response fields

| Field | Type | Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ActionStatus | String | Mandatory | Processed Request Result:OK Signifies Successful HandlingFAILURE signifies unsuccessful execution |
| ErrorCode | Integer | Mandatory | Error Identifier:0: Allow Speaking1: Refuse to Speak2: Silent discardIf the service wishes to reject a speech while conveying the error code ErrorCode and ErrorInfo to the client, please set the ErrorCode within the range [120001, 130000]. |
