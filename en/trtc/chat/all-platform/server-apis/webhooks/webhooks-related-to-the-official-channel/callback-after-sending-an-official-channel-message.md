# Callback After Sending an Official Channel Message

## Feature Overview

The app backend can use this webhook to check the broadcast messages of the official channel in real time, including notifications that the app backend has successfully sent a official channel message, allowing the app to perform the necessary data synchronization.

## Notes

- To enable the webhook, you must configure the Webhook URL and enable the corresponding switch for this webhook. For more information on the configuration method, see [Webhook Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this webhook event, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the webhook request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For more security considerations, please refer to the [Webhook Overview: Security Considerations](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354) document.

## Webhook Triggering Scenarios

- An app user sends a Official Account Message via the client.
- The app administrator sends a Official Account Message via RESTful APIs.

## Webhook Triggering Timing

The webhook is triggered after the Chat backend delivers the official channel message to subscribers.
