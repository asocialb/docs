# Webhook After Recalling Official Channel Messages

## Feature Overview

The App backend can view the revocation of Official Channel messages in real-time via this webhook.

## Notes

- To enable the webhook, you must configure the Webhook URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For more information on the configuration method, see [Webhook Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34520) document.
- During this webhook, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the webhook request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For more security considerations, please refer to the [Webhook Overview: Security Considerations](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354) document.

## Webhook Triggering Scenarios
