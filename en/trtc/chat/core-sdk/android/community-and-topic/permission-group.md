# Permission Group

## Feature Description

For permission groups, users can define permissions for groups as needed and configure different permissions and members for different permission groups, so that users can manage groups by permissions. Community groups can be managed by permission groups. Management of permission groups is more flexible than that of [admins](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/48181?lang=en&pg=#setting-an-admin) with fixed roles, making it suitable for communities with many members and topics.

> **Note:**The permission group feature is supported for version 7.8 and later.To use this feature, you need to [purchase the Pro edition ãPro Plus edition or Enterprise edition](https://trtc.io/buy/chat), log in to the [Console](https://console.trtc.io/), and enable the Community Switch. The switch path is: Applications > Your App > Chat > Configuration > Group Configuration > Community.

The permission group `V2TIMPermissionGroupInfo` includes three elements: community permissions `groupPermission`, topic permissions `topicPermission`, and the group members who have these permissions. As shown in the figure above, users can configure different community permissions `groupPermission` and topic permissions `topicPermission` for different permission groups, and add different group members to achieve differentiated permission management. In addition, users can set default permissions `defaultPermissions` for communities and topics in community information `V2TIMGroupInfo` and topic information `V2TIMTopicInfo`. In this case, all group members have these default permissions. The rules for permission group management are as follows:

- [To enable the permission group feature](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/59829#185b30c6-5226-4ce8-8786-69f7655a8ad6), set `enablePermissionGroup` to `true`. In this case, the permissions of [admins](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/48181?lang=en&pg=#setting-an-admin) are disabled, making admins equivalent to ordinary group members. Conversely, setting it to `false` deactivates the permission group management feature and restores the permissions of [admins](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/48181?lang=en&pg=#setting-an-admin).
- Default community permissions [defaultPermissions](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/59829#4335c6d4-16c6-40dd-b3f9-d66f4bd9b238) and default topic permissions [defaultPermissions](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/59829#6e517737-7cf4-47ab-ba56-f55e6c73616f) are automatically created in the community information `V2TIMGroupInfo` and topic information `V2TIMTopicInfo`, which are effective for all group members **everyone** (excluding the group owner).
- Users can set community permissions `groupPermission` in permission groups `V2TIMPermissionGroupInfo` when [creating permission groups](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/59829#d28082e3-88bc-410f-b63a-fc55bc3fe0cf), and then [change the permissions](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/59829#8dcdb1c1-60ae-404f-ac2b-071be1f45846) later. Users can call the [addTopicPermissionToPermissionGroup](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/59829#4c0f60f9-9897-4756-ad88-fed5351927ee) API to add topic permissions `topicPermission` to permission groups. The community permissions and topic permissions of a permission group are valid only for members in the group.
- Permissions are represented by a 64-bit value, with each bit representing a permission. A bit value of 0 indicates that the permission is disabled, while a bit value of 1 indicates that the permission is enabled. The [table of bits for community and topic permissions](#permission_bit) is as follows. For example, if the community permission value of a permission group is set to 5 (101 in binary mode), the members in the permission group have the permissions to modify group information and manage permission group information.
- A group member's permission consists of the default **everyone** permission and the union of permissions from multiple permission groups that the member belongs to. That is, the group member has this permission when it is enabled anywhere.
- The group owner always has all the permissions.

## Examples

We use a scenario to introduce the permission group usage process. A sports community involves 3 topics, including **Important Notification, Basketball**, and **Football**. All members have the permission to retrieve historical messages sent before group joining in the**Important notification** topic, and the permission to send messages in the **Basketball** and **Football** topics. Member a has the permissions to modify community information, manage group members, and send messages in the **Important notification** topic, while members b and c have the permission to mute members in the **Basketball** and **Football** topics.

The process is as follows:

1. **This is very important:** In the community, set `enablePermissionGroup` to `true` to [enable the permission group feature](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/59829#185b30c6-5226-4ce8-8786-69f7655a8ad6). This step can be the last step.
2. Set `defaultPermissions` to 0 to disable all the [everyone permissions for communities](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/59829#4335c6d4-16c6-40dd-b3f9-d66f4bd9b238), so no member has any community permissions.
3. Set the [everyone permissions](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/59829#6e517737-7cf4-47ab-ba56-f55e6c73616f) `defaultPermissions` to 16 (10000 in binary mode) for the **Important Notification** topic, that is, `V2TIM_TOPIC_PERMISSION_GET_HISTORY_MESSAGE`. Set the [everyone permissions](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/59829#6e517737-7cf4-47ab-ba56-f55e6c73616f) defaultPermissions to 8 (1000 in binary mode) for the **Basketball** and **Football** topics, that is, `V2TIM_TOPIC_PERMISSION_SEND_MESSAGE`. In this case, all members can retrieve historical messages sent before group joining in the **Important notification** topic and send messages in the **Basketball** and **Football** topics.
4. [Create a permission group](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/59829#d28082e3-88bc-410f-b63a-fc55bc3fe0cf) named Community Management, and set the community permission `groupPermission` to 3 (11 in binary mode), which is the OR operation value specified by `V2TIM_COMMUNITY_PERMISSION_MANAGE_GROUP_INFO | V2TIM_COMMUNITY_PERMISSION_MANAGE_GROUP_MEMBER` for the permission. [Add the messaging permission](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/59829#4c0f60f9-9897-4756-ad88-fed5351927ee) `topicPermission` in the **Important notification** topic, and set it to 8 (1000 in binary mode), that is `V2TIM_TOPIC_PERMISSION_SEND_MESSAGE`. After being [added to the permission group](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/59829#d5c2fe24-49a8-492d-a6fc-c29ae3ee4d86), group member a will have permissions to modify community information, manage group members, and send messages in the **Important notification** topic.
5. [Create a permission group](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/59829#d28082e3-88bc-410f-b63a-fc55bc3fe0cf) named Topic Management, disable all community permissions, and set `groupPermission` to 0. [Add the mute permission](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/59829#4c0f60f9-9897-4756-ad88-fed5351927ee) `topicPermission` in the **Basketball** and **Football** topics, and set it to 4 (100 in binary mode), that is `V2TIM_TOPIC_PERMISSION_MUTE_MEMBER`. After being [added to this permission group](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/59829#d5c2fe24-49a8-492d-a6fc-c29ae3ee4d86), group members b and c will have permissions to mute members in the **Basketball** and **Football** topics.

## Community Permission Management

### Enabling/Disabling the Permission Group Feature

Groups can be managed by either admins or permission groups. When the permission group feature is enabled, the admin role is disabled, making admins equivalent to ordinary group members. When the permission group feature is disabled, the admin permissions are restored.

Set `enablePermissionGroup` ([Java](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/classcom_1_1tencent_1_1imsdk_1_1v2_1_1V2TIMGroupInfo.html#ab4d8d679ece65113fa04ef09a4a50b70), [Swift](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/swift_V2TIMGroupInfo.html#v2timgroupinfo.enablepermissiongroup),[Objective-C](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/interfaceV2TIMGroupInfo.html#af780df9d08aa6a0166d90758b251a38a), [C++](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/structV2TIMGroupInfo.html#afde788403e154c3faa211b3d20bb2544)) to enable or disable the permission group feature. When the feature is enabled, the admin role is disabled. When the feature is disabled, the admin permissions are restored.

The sample code is as follows:

Java

Swift

Objective-C

C++

```
V2TIMGroupInfo groupInfo = new V2TIMGroupInfo();groupInfo.setGroupID("ID of the community for which the permission group feature needs to be enabled");groupInfo.setEnablePermissionGroup(true);V2TIMManager.getGroupManager().setGroupInfo(groupInfo, new V2TIMCallback() {    @Override    public void onSuccess() {        // The permission group feature is enabled successfully    }    @Override    public void onError(int code, String desc) {        // The permission group feature fails to be enabled    }});// Group event listenerV2TIMManager.getInstance().addGroupListener(new V2TIMGroupListener() {    @Override    public void onGroupInfoChanged(String groupID, List<V2TIMGroupChangeInfo> changeInfos) {        // Group information update callback    }});
```

```
let groupInfo = V2TIMGroupInfo()groupInfo.groupID = "groupID"groupInfo.enablePermissionGroup = trueV2TIMManager.shared.setGroupInfo(info: groupInfo) {    print( "setGroupInfo succ")} fail: { code, desc in    print( "setGroupInfo fail, \\(code), \\(desc)")}V2TIMManager.shared.addGroupListener(listener: self)func onGroupInfoChanged(groupID: String, changeInfoList: Array<V2TIMGroupChangeInfo>) {    print( "groupID:\\(groupID), changeInfoList:\\(changeInfoList)")}
```

```
V2TIMGroupInfo *info = [[V2TIMGroupInfo alloc] init];info.groupID = @"ID of the community for which the permission group feature needs to be enabled";info.enablePermissionGroup = YES;[[V2TIMManager sharedInstance] setGroupInfo:info succ:^{    // The permission group feature is enabled successfully} fail:^(int code, NSString *msg) {    // The permission group feature fails to be enabled}];// Group event listener[[V2TIMManager sharedInstance] addGroupListener:self];- (void)onGroupInfoChanged:(NSString *)groupID changeInfoList:(NSArray<V2TIMGroupChangeInfo *>*)changeInfoList {    // Group information update callback}
```

```
V2TIMGroupInfo info;info.groupID = "ID of the community for which the permission group feature needs to be enabled";info.enablePermissionGroup = true;info.modifyFlag |= (uint32_t)V2TIM_GROUP_INFO_MODIFY_FLAG_ENABLE_PERMISSION_GROUP;class TestCallBack : public V2TIMValueCallback<V2TIMString> {    void OnSuccess(const V2TIMString &value)override {        // The permission group feature is enabled successfully    }    void OnError(int error_code, const V2TIMString &error_message) override {        // The permission group feature fails to be enabled    }};auto *callback = new TestCallBack;V2TIMManager::GetInstance()->GetGroupManager()->SetGroupInfo(info, callback);// Group event listenerclass GroupListener final : public V2TIMGroupListener {public:    GroupListener() = default;    ~GroupListener() override = default;        void OnGroupInfoChanged(const V2TIMString &groupID, const V2TIMGroupChangeInfoVector &changeInfos)override {        // Group information update notification    }};GroupListener groupListener;V2TIMManager::GetInstance()->AddGroupListener(&groupListener);
```

### Default Community Permissions

Group owners and members with permission to modify group information can set `defaultPermissions` ([Java](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/classcom_1_1tencent_1_1imsdk_1_1v2_1_1V2TIMGroupInfo.html#acb68084ffdcc522f4b8114fed65ac161), [Swift](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/swift_V2TIMGroupInfo.html#v2timgroupinfo.defaultpermissions) , [Objective-C](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/interfaceV2TIMGroupInfo.html#ae60e1f3a01097aa3315c68b1f0f02b1c), [C++](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/structV2TIMGroupInfo.html#ae60e1f3a01097aa3315c68b1f0f02b1c)) in `V2TIMGroupInfo` to change the default permissions of communities. These default permissions are effective for all group members **everyone** (excluding the group owner).

The sample code is as follows:

Java

Swift

Objective-C

C++

```
// Assume that it is required to allow all group members to send messages and retrieve historical messages sent before community joining in all topics by default, with other permissions disabledlong communityPermission = V2TIMPermissionGroupInfo.V2TIM_COMMUNITY_PERMISSION_SEND_MESSAGE | V2TIMPermissionGroupInfo.V2TIM_COMMUNITY_PERMISSION_GET_HISTORY_MESSAGE;V2TIMGroupInfo groupInfo = new V2TIMGroupInfo();groupInfo.setGroupID("ID of the community to be modified");groupInfo.setDefaultPermissions(communityPermission);V2TIMManager.getGroupManager().setGroupInfo(groupInfo, new V2TIMCallback() {    @Override    public void onSuccess() {      // Default permissions are set successfully    }        @Override public void onError(int code, String desc) {      // Default permissions fail to be set    }});// Group profile modification notificationV2TIMManager.getInstance().addGroupListener(new V2TIMGroupListener() {    @Override    public void onGroupInfoChanged(String groupID, List<V2TIMGroupChangeInfo> changeInfos) {      // Group information update callback    }});
```

```
let groupInfo = V2TIMGroupInfo()groupInfo.groupID = "groupID"groupInfo.enablePermissionGroup = truegroupInfo.defaultPermissions = V2TIMCommunityPermissionValue.V2TIM_COMMUNITY_PERMISSION_SEND_MESSAGE.rawValue | V2TIMCommunityPermissionValue.V2TIM_COMMUNITY_PERMISSION_GET_HISTORY_MESSAGE.rawValue;V2TIMManager.shared.setGroupInfo(info: groupInfo) {    print( "setGroupInfo succ")} fail: { code, desc in    print( "setGroupInfo fail, \\(code), \\(desc)")}V2TIMManager.shared.addGroupListener(listener: self)func onGroupInfoChanged(groupID: String, changeInfoList: Array<V2TIMGroupChangeInfo>) {    print( "groupID:\\(groupID), changeInfoList:\\(changeInfoList)")}
```

```
// Assume that it is required to allow all group members to send messages and retrieve historical messages sent before community joining in all topics by default, with other permissions disabledV2TIMGroupInfo *info = [[V2TIMGroupInfo alloc] init];info.groupID = @"ID of the community to be modified";info.defaultPermissions = V2TIM_COMMUNITY_PERMISSION_SEND_MESSAGE |V2TIM_COMMUNITY_PERMISSION_GET_HISTORY_MESSAGE;[[V2TIMManager sharedInstance] setGroupInfo:info succ:^{    // Default permissions are set successfully} fail:^(int code, NSString *msg) {    // Default permissions fail to be set}];// Group event listener[[V2TIMManager sharedInstance] addGroupListener:self];- (void)onGroupInfoChanged:(NSString *)groupID changeInfoList:(NSArray<V2TIMGroupChangeInfo *>*)changeInfoList {    // Group profile update callback}
```

```

```

### Creating a Permission Group

Group owners and members with permission to manage group information can call `createPermissionGroupInCommunity` ([Java](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/classcom_1_1tencent_1_1imsdk_1_1v2_1_1V2TIMCommunityManager.html#a92908f8d46063504d6f8b0d0f04f3a6b),[Swift](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/swift_V2TIMManager+Community.html#v2timmanager.createpermissiongroupincommunity(permissiongroupinfo:succ:fail:)), [Objective-C](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/categoryV2TIMManager_07Community_08.html#a476609aac093b8d0aa3404992c4919bd), [C++](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/classV2TIMCommunityManager.html#a2707a4f2b24761c6cd48a52157ccf132)) to create up to 20 permission groups by default.

The sample code is as follows:

Java

Swift

Objective-C

C++

```
V2TIMPermissionGroupInfo v2TIMPermissionGroupInfo = new V2TIMPermissionGroupInfo();v2TIMPermissionGroupInfo.setGroupID("ID of the community for which a permission group needs to be created");v2TIMPermissionGroupInfo.setPermissionGroupID("Permission group ID, which can be left blank or custom");v2TIMPermissionGroupInfo.setPermissionGroupName("Permission group name");v2TIMPermissionGroupInfo.setCustomData("Custom character string of the permission group");// Members of this permission group have the [permission to modify group information] and [permission to manage group members] long communityPermission =V2TIMPermissionGroupInfo.V2TIM_COMMUNITY_PERMISSION_MANAGE_GROUP_INFO |V2TIMPermissionGroupInfo.V2TIM_COMMUNITY_PERMISSION_MANAGE_GROUP_MEMBER;v2TIMPermissionGroupInfo.setGroupPermission(communityPermission);V2TIMManager.getCommunityManager().createPermissionGroupInCommunity(v2TIMPermissionGroupInfo, new V2TIMValueCallback<String>() {    @Override    public void onSuccess(String permissionGroupID) {      // The permission group is created successfully    }        @Override    public void onError(int code, String desc) {      // The permission group fails to be created    }});// Community group event listenerV2TIMManager.getCommunityManager().addCommunityListener(new V2TIMCommunityListener() {    @Override    public void onCreatePermissionGroup(String groupID, V2TIMPermissionGroupInfo permissionGroupInfo) {      // Permission group creation notification    }});

## Topic Permission Management

### Default Topic Permission

Group owners and members with the topic management permission can call `setTopicInfo` ([Java](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/classcom_1_1tencent_1_1imsdk_1_1v2_1_1V2TIMCommunityManager.html#acaff2edad6eb208478be9ab06d30035d), [Swift](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/swift_V2TIMManager+Community.html#v2timmanager.settopicinfo(topicinfo:succ:fail:)) ,[Objective-C](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/categoryV2TIMManager_07Community_08.html#a237e2fa6e16e55143c516c5428a23936), [C++](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/classV2TIMCommunityManager.html#a128f08ef6e675d7c8fc96a5d124e59af)) to modify the default permission of a topic. The default permission of the topic applies to all group members (excluding the group owner).

The sample code is as follows:

Java

Swift

Objective-C

C++

```
// Assume that it is required for all community members to have permissions to send messages in the current topic and retrieve historical messages sent before community joining in the topiclong topicPermission = V2TIMPermissionGroupInfo.V2TIM_TOPIC_PERMISSION_SEND_MESSAGE |V2TIMPermissionGroupInfo.V2TIM_TOPIC_PERMISSION_GET_HISTORY_MESSAGE;V2TIMTopicInfo topicInfo = new V2TIMTopicInfo();topicInfo.setTopicID("ID of the topic for which the default topic permission needs to be set");topicInfo.setDefaultPermissions(topicPermission);V2TIMManager.getCommunityManager().setTopicInfo(topicInfo,new V2TIMCallback() {    @Override    public void onSuccess() {      // The default topic permission is successfully modified    }        @Override public voidonError(int code, String desc) {      // The default topic permission fails to be modified    }});// Community group event listenerV2TIMManager.getCommunityManager().addCommunityListener(new V2TIMCommunityListener() {    @Override    public void onChangeTopicInfo(String groupID, V2TIMTopicInfo topicInfo) {      // Topic information update notification    }});

```

### Adding Topic Permissions to a Permission Group

Group owners and members with the permission to manage group information can call `addTopicPermissionToPermissionGroup` ([Java](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/classcom_1_1tencent_1_1imsdk_1_1v2_1_1V2TIMCommunityManager.html#a7e7d5b6960571ddbf61ba5a6f7390bc9),[Swift](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/swift_V2TIMManager+Community.html#v2timmanager.addtopicpermissiontopermissiongroup(groupid:permissiongroupid:topicpermissionmap:succ:fail:)),[Objective-C](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/categoryV2TIMManager_07Community_08.html#a538a722d29fa2e0f2841b70cb6e050f4), [C++](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/classV2TIMCommunityManager.html#a469f912625330ccf3b0313c5a6d49603)) to add topic permissions to a permission group. These permissions are effective for members of the permission group.
