# Group Profile

## Feature Description

The group profile refers to the information about the group, which can be obtained through the method in the `TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager.getGroupManager()` core class.

## Getting the Group Profile

Call `getGroupsInfo` ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_cloud_chat_sdk/latest/manager_v2_tim_group_manager/V2TIMGroupManager/getGroupsInfo.html)) to get the group profile. This API supports passing in multiple `groupID` values at a time to batch get group profiles.

Sample code:

```
// Get the group profileV2TimValueCallback<List<V2TimGroupInfoResult>> groupinfos = await groupManager.getGroupsInfo(groupIDList: ['groupid1']);
```

## Modifying the Group Profile

Call `setGroupInfo` ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_cloud_chat_sdk/latest/manager_v2_tim_group_manager/V2TIMGroupManager/setGroupInfo.html)) to modify the group profile.

If you have called `addGroupListener` to add a group event listener in advance, after the group profile is modified, all the group members will receive the `onGroupInfoChanged` callback ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_cloud_chat_sdk/latest/enum_V2TimGroupListener/V2TimGroupListener/onGroupInfoChanged.html)).

Member roles that can modify the group profile vary by group type as follows:

| Group Type | Member Roles Allowed to Modify the **Basic Group Profile** |
| --- | --- |
| Work group (Work) | All group members |
| Public group (Public) | Group owner and admin |
| Meeting group (Meeting) | Group owner and admin |
| Community (Community) | Group owner and admin |
| Audio-video group (AVChatRoom) | Group owner |

Sample code:

```
groupManager.setGroupInfo(info: V2TimGroupInfo.fromJson({    "groupAddOpt":GroupAddOptTypeEnum.V2TIM_GROUP_ADD_AUTH    // ...Other profiles  }));// CallbackTencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager.addGroupListener(listener: V2TimGroupListener(onGroupInfoChanged: ((groupID, changeInfos) {    // The group information was changed.  })));
```

## Setting the Group Message Receiving Option

Any group member can call the `setGroupReceiveMessageOpt` API ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_cloud_chat_sdk/latest/manager_v2_tim_message_manager/V2TIMMessageManager/setGroupReceiveMessageOpt.html)) to change the group message receiving option.

`V2TIMReceiveMessageOpt` has the following options:

| Message Receiving Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ReceiveMsgOptEnum.V2TIM_RECEIVE_MESSAGE | Messages will be received when the user is online, and push notifications will be received when the user is offline. |
| ReceiveMsgOptEnum.V2TIM_NOT_RECEIVE_MESSAGE | No group messages will be received. |
| ReceiveMsgOptEnum.V2TIM_RECEIVE_NOT_NOTIFY_MESSAGE | Messages will be received when the user is online, and no push notifications will be received when the user is offline. |

Different `V2TIMReceiveMessageOpt` options can be used to implement group message notification muting:

**No group messages will be received.**
With the group message receiving option set to `V2TIM_NOT_RECEIVE_MESSAGE`, no group message will be received, and the conversation list will not be updated.

**Group messages will be received but will not be notified to the user, and a badge without the unread count will be displayed on the conversation list UI.**

1. The group message receiving option is set to `V2TIM_RECEIVE_NOT_NOTIFY_MESSAGE`.
2. When the receiver receives a new group message and needs to update the conversation list, it can get the unread count through `unreadCount` ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_cloud_chat_sdk/latest/models_v2_tim_conversation/V2TimConversation/unreadCount.html)) in `V2TIMConversation`.
3. The receiver displays a badge rather than the unread count when identifying the group message receiving option as `V2TIM_RECEIVE_NOT_NOTIFY_MESSAGE` based on the `recvOpt` ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_cloud_chat_sdk/latest/models_v2_tim_conversation/V2TimConversation/recvOpt.html)) of `V2TIMConversation`.

> **Note:** As this method requires the unread count feature, it applies only to work groups (Work) and public groups (Public).

Sample code:

```
// Set the group message receiving optiongroupManager.setGroupInfo(info: V2TimGroupInfo.fromJson({    "groupAddOpt":GroupAddOptTypeEnum.V2TIM_GROUP_ADD_AUTH    // ...Other profiles  }));
```
