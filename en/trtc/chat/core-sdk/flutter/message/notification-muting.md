# Notification Muting

## Feature Description

You can set the message receiving option for a **one-to-one or group chat** to implement the notification muting feature.

The Chat SDK supports the following three message receiving options as defined in `V2TIMReceiveMessageOpt`:

| Message Receiving Option | Feature Description |
| --- | --- |
| ReceiveMsgOptEnum.V2TIM_RECEIVE_MESSAGE | Messages will be received when the user is online, and offline push notifications will be received when the user is offline. |
| ReceiveMsgOptEnum.V2TIM_NOT_RECEIVE_MESSAGE | Messages will not be received no matter whether the user is online or offline. |
| ReceiveMsgOptEnum.V2TIM_RECEIVE_NOT_NOTIFY_MESSAGE | Messages will be received when the user is online, and offline push notifications will not be received when the user is offline. |

Different `V2TIMReceiveMessageOpt` options can be used to implement group message notification muting:
**No messages will be received.**
After the message receiving option is set to `V2TIM_NOT_RECEIVE_MESSAGE`, no one-to-one or group messages will be received, and the conversation list will not be updated.

**Messages will be received but will not be notified to the user, and a badge without the unread count will be displayed on the conversation list UI.**

1. The message receiving option is set to `V2TIM_RECEIVE_NOT_NOTIFY_MESSAGE`.
2. When the receiver receives a one-to-one or group message and needs to update the conversation list, it can get the unread count through the `unreadCount` ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_cloud_chat_sdk/latest/models_v2_tim_conversation/V2TimConversation/unreadCount.html)) in the `V2TIMConversation` of the conversation.
3. The receiver displays a badge rather than the unread count when identifying the message receiving option as `V2TIM_RECEIVE_NOT_NOTIFY_MESSAGE` based on the `recvOpt` ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_cloud_chat_sdk/latest/models_v2_tim_conversation/V2TimConversation/recvOpt.html)) in `V2TIMConversation`.

> **Note:** As this method requires the unread count feature, it applies only to work groups (Work) and public groups (Public). For more information on group types, see Group Overview.

## Setting the Message Receiving Option for a One-to-One Chat

Call the `setC2CReceiveMessageOpt` API ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_cloud_chat_sdk/latest/manager_v2_tim_message_manager/V2TIMMessageManager/setC2CReceiveMessageOpt.html)) to set the message receiving option for a one-to-one chat.

You can use the `userIDList` parameter to specify up to 30 users at a time.

> **Caution:** This API can be called up to 5 times every second.

Sample code:

```
// Set not to receive messages no matter whether the user is online or offlineTencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager.getMessageManager().setC2CReceiveMessageOpt(userIDList: ['user1','user2'], opt: ReceiveMsgOptEnum.V2TIM_NOT_RECEIVE_MESSAGE);
```

## Getting the Message Receiving Option for a One-to-One Chat

Call the `getC2CReceiveMessageOpt` API ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_cloud_chat_sdk/latest/manager_v2_tim_message_manager/V2TIMMessageManager/getC2CReceiveMessageOpt.html)) to get the message receiving option for a one-to-one chat.

Sample code:

```
V2TimValueCallback<List<V2TimReceiveMessageOptInfo>> messageOpt = await TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager.getMessageManager().getC2CReceiveMessageOpt(userIDList: ['user1','user2']);  messageOpt.data.forEach((element) {    // Message receiving option    element.c2CReceiveMessageOpt;    element.userID;  });
```

## Setting the Message Receiving Option for a Group Chat

Call the `setGroupReceiveMessageOpt` API ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_cloud_chat_sdk/latest/manager_v2_tim_message_manager/V2TIMMessageManager/setGroupReceiveMessageOpt.html)) to set the message receiving option for a group chat.

Sample code:

```
TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager.getMessageManager().setGroupReceiveMessageOpt(groupID: "groupID", opt: ReceiveMsgOptEnum.V2TIM_NOT_RECEIVE_MESSAGE);
```

## Getting the Message Receiving Option for a Group Chat

Call the `getGroupsInfo` API ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_cloud_chat_sdk/latest/manager_v2_tim_group_manager/V2TIMGroupManager/getGroupsInfo.html)) to get the `V2TIMGroupInfo` group profile object list. Here, the `recvOpt` field indicates the message receiving option for the group chat.

Sample code:

```
V2TimValueCallback<List<V2TimGroupInfoResult>> groups = await TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager.getGroupManager().getGroupsInfo(groupIDList: ['groupID']);  groups.data.forEach((element) {     // Get the message receiving option of the group    element.groupInfo.recvOpt;  });
```
