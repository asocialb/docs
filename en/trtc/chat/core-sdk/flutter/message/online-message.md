# Online Message

## Feature Description

In certain cases, you might want a message to be received by the receiver only when online; that is, the receiver won't notice the message when offline. You only need to set `onlineUserOnly` to `true` when calling `sendMessage`. A message sent in this way differs from a general one in that:

1. It cannot be stored offline; that is, it cannot be received if the receiver is offline.
2. It cannot be roamed across devices; that is, if it is received on a device, it cannot be received on another, whether it is read or not.
3. It cannot be stored locally; that is, it cannot be pulled from local or cloud historical messages.

## Sample

### Implementing the feature of "The other party is typing..."

In one-to-one chats, you can call the `sendMessage` API ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_cloud_chat_sdk/latest/manager_v2_tim_message_manager/V2TIMMessageManager/sendMessage.html)) to send the prompt "Typing...". After receiving the prompt message, the receiver can display "The other party is typing..." on the UI.

Sample code:

```
V2TimValueCallback<V2TimMsgCreateInfoResult> createCustomMessageRes =      await TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager          .getMessageManager()          .createCustomMessage(            data: 'Typing...',          );  TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager.getMessageManager().sendMessage(id: createCustomMessageRes.data.id, receiver: "", groupID: "",onlineUserOnly: true);
```
