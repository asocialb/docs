# Cloud Search Users

## Feature Description

Search cloud users, supporting quick search by keywords. Users can quickly locate known users, such as friends or followed contacts, through this API; meanwhile, they can also use keywords for the discovery of new users, to expand social circle or find interested users.

> **Notes:**The message translation feature is only available to customers of Pro Plus and Enterprise. It can be used after [purchasing Pro Plus and Enterprise](https://trtc.io/buy/chat); the Free Trial version supports [a certain limit of free trial](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/67651#d1113f0d-47e8-4211-82c0-00d2efb72586), valid for one month.The cloud user search feature is supported from **v3.5.0**.Search scope: fuzzy search matching for all users' nicknames based on keywords, precise search matching for all users' userID.The profile in the list of users obtained is incomplete (only includes avatar, nickname, userID, gender, birthday, selfSignature, etc., which is sufficient to meet the rendering needs of user search result list, excluding custom fields). To query the detailed user profile, see: [getUserProfile](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/48161#querying-the-profile-of-another-user).The maximum number of search results per time is 100.This API has a cloud frequency limit of 2 times/second, and a local API call limit of 20 times/5 seconds.
