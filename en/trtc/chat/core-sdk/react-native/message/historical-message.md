# Historical Message

## Feature Overview

The SDK supports message pull by page, sequence, or time range. Historical messages stored in the cloud are subject to the following time limits:

- Developer edition: The free storage period is 7 days and cannot be extended.
- Standard edition: The free storage period is 7 days and cannot be extended.
- Pro edition :The free storage period is 30 days and cannot be extended.
- Pro Plus edition :The free storage period is 60 days and cannot be extended.
- Enterprise edition: The free storage period is 90 days and cannot be extended.

> **Note**Extending the storage period of historical messages is a Value-Added Service. You can log in to the [Chat Console](https://console.trtc.io/) to modify the relevant configuration. For billing details, see [Pricing](https://trtc.io/pricing/chat). Rich media messages (such as images, files, and audios) have the same storage periods as historical messages.

## Pulling a Message List

### getMessageList

This API is used to pull the list of messages in a specified conversation by page. It needs to be called when the message list is rendered for the first time after the user enters the conversation, or when the user pulls down the list to view more messages.

> **Note**This interface can be used for "pulling historical messages" (excluding AVChatRoom).AVChatRoom does not store historical messages by default. When new users enter the AVChatRoom, they can only see messages sent after they joined. To enhance user engagement and participation in the AVChatRoom, you can update the number of recent messages that new members can view in the Chat console > Application Configuration > Feature Configuration > Group Configuration -> Live Group New Member View Pre-join Message Quantity Configuration. This feature is only available in the Pro edition ãPro Plus edition or Enterprise edition. New group members can view the latest messages generated within the 24 hours before they joined, up to a maximum of 20 messages.If you want to search for local messages, please use `findMessage`. If you want to search for all cloud messages, please use `searchCloudMessages `(this feature is a Value-Added Service, and you need to purchase the cloud search plugin. Please click to [buy](https://console.trtc.io/chat/plugin/TUICloudSearch)).
