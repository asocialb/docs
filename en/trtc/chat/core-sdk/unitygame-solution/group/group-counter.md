# Group Counter

## Overview

Starting from native SDK v7.0, Tencent Cloud Chat SDK provides the group counter feature. You can configure a certain number of counters for each group.

Unlike [custom group attributes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/48175), group counters are used to store data of integer type. Group counters can be used to store additional information related to a group, such as the cumulative number of viewers, the number of views, the number of likes, and the number of gifts the audience has given to the host of an audio-video group.

> **Note:**Group counters support all types of groups, excluding topic-enabled community groups.The group counter feature is supported only by the Pro edition ãPro Plus edition or Enterprise edition.

Keep the following in mind for group counters:

1. A single group supports up to 20 group counters, that is, up to 20 keys per group.
2. For a single group counter, the key can contain up to 128 bytes, and the value must be of integer type (signed integer of up to 64 bits).
3. The `GroupSetGroupCounters`, `GroupIncreaseGroupCounter`, and `GroupDecreaseGroupCounter` APIs together can be called by a logged-in user up to 20 times every five seconds in the SDK, and the 8516 error code will be called back if the limit is exceeded.
4. The `GroupGetGroupCounters` API can be called by a logged-in user up to 20 times every five seconds in the SDK, and the 8516 error code will be called back if the limit is exceeded.

## Setting Group Counters

> **Note:**If the `key` of the group counter to be set already exists, the value of `key` is updated directly. Otherwise, a key-value pair will be added.If multiple users set the same counter at the same time, the final value of the counter will be used. It's recommended that the group owner performs counter setting operations.

Sample: Call the `GroupSetGroupCounters` API to set the values of counters `key1` and `key2` to 0

```
    // Set a group counter    List<GroupCounter> list = new List<GroupCounter>    {      new GroupCounter      {        group_counter_key = "key",        group_counter_value = 1      }    };    TIMResult res = TencentIMSDK.GroupSetGroupCounters("groupID", list, (int code, string desc, List<GroupCounter> results, string user_data)=>{      // Async result of the group counter setting    });
```

## Incrementing the Value of a Group Counter

> **Note:**The API parameter `value` is the change value. Each time when the API is called, the current value is incremented by the value passed in.If the `key` of the group counter to be set already exists, the current value is directly incremented by the value passed in. Otherwise, a `key` will be added, and the default value (0) is incremented by the value passed in.

Sample: Assume that the current value of counter `key1` is 8. After you call the `GroupIncreaseGroupCounter` API to pass in an increment value 2, the final value of `key1` becomes 10.

```
    // Increment the value of a group counter    TIMResult res = TencentIMSDK.GroupIncreaseGroupCounter("groupID", "key1", 2, (int code, string desc, List<GroupCounter> results, string user_data)=>{      // Async result of the group counter increment    });
```

## Decrementing the Value of a Group Counter

> **Note:**The API parameter `value` is the change value. Each time when the API is called, the current value is decreased by the value passed in.If the `key` of the group counter to be set already exists, the current value is directly decremented by the value passed in. Otherwise, a `key` will be added, and the default value (0) is decreased by the value passed in.

Sample: Assume that the current value of counter `key1` is 8. After you call the `GroupDecreaseGroupCounter` API to pass in a decrement value 2, the final value of `key1` becomes 6.

```
    // Decrement the value of a group counter    TIMResult res = TencentIMSDK.GroupDecreaseGroupCounter("groupID", "key1", 2, (int code, string desc, List<GroupCounter> results, string user_data)=>{      // Async result of the group counter decrement    });
```

## Getting Group Counters

> **Note:** If the key list passed in is empty, all group counters are returned.

Sample: Call the `GroupGetGroupCounters`` API to get the values of counters `key1` and `key2`

```
    // Get group counters    TIMResult res = TencentIMSDK.GroupGetGroupCounters("groupID", new List<string> {"key1", "key2"}, (int code, string desc, List<GroupCounter> results, string user_data)=>{      // Async result of the group counter getting    });
```

## Group Counter Change Notification

> **Note:** Before you can invoke the above-mentioned callback, you need to call the `SetGroupCounterChangedCallback` ([details](https://comm.qq.com/im/doc/unity/zh/api/SDKRegisteringCallback/SetGroupCounterChangedCallback.html)) API to add a group listener.

Sample code:

```
    // Set the group counter change callback    TencentIMSDK.SetGroupCounterChangedCallback((string group_id, string group_counter_key, ulong group_counter_new_value, string user_data) => {    });
```
