### Group features

Based on common use cases, Chat provides the following default group types:

- A work group (Work) allows users to join the group by being invited by a friend who is a member of the group. The invitation does not need to be accepted by the invitee or approved by the group owner.
- A public group (Public) allows the group owner to designate group admins. To join the group, a user needs to search for the group ID and send a request, and the request needs to be approved by the group owner or an admin before the user can join the group.
- A meeting group (Meeting) allows users to join and exit freely and supports viewing message history from before the user joined the group. Meeting groups are ideal for scenarios that integrate Tencent Real-Time Communication (TRTC), such as audio and video conferences and online education.
- An audio-video group (AVChatRoom) allows users to join and exit freely, supports an unlimited number of members, and does not store message history. Livestreaming groups can be used with Live Video Broadcasting (LVB) to support on-screen comment chat scenarios.
- A community group (Community) allows users to join and exit freely, supports up to 100,000 members, and stores message history. To join the group, a user needs to search for the group ID and send an application, and the application does not need to be approved by an admin before the user can join the group.

> **Note:**Community is a new powerful tool for entertainment collaboration. Within the same community, a high number of members can be divided into different groups and topics to separate messages for hierarchical communication, yet they can also share the same set of friend relationships. This helps you explore a unique path of social expansion. The community feature is suitable for diverse use cases, such as finding like-minded people, game-based social networking, fan marketing, and organization management.Community: The community feature is supported by a client with the SDK enhanced edition v5.8.1668 or later and the web SDK v2.17.0 or later. To use it, you need to purchase the [ProãPro PlusãEnterprise](https://console.trtc.io/subscription/buy/chat?packType=pro), and then enable it via [console](https://console.trtc.io/chat) > **Feature Configuration** > **Group configuration** > **Group feature configuration** > **Community**.
