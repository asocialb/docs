# After a Room Is Created

## Feature Overview

The App backend can view information about the room created by the user in real time through this callback, including notifications of successful room creation in the app backend, allowing for actions such as data synchronization.

## Notes

- To enable the callback, a callback URL must be configured and the switch corresponding to this callback protocol activated. For configuration methods, see [Third-party Callback Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34520) document.
- The direction of the callback is from the Room backend to the App backend via an HTTP POST request.
- After receiving the callback request, the App backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.

## Scenarios

- App users successfully create a room through the client.
- App administrators successfully create a room through the RESTful API.

## Callback Trigger Time

After the room is created successfully.
