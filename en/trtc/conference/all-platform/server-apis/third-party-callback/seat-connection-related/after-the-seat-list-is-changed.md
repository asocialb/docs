# After the Seat List Is Changed

## Feature Overview

The App backend can view  position list change messages in real time through this callback.

## Notes

- To enable the callback, a callback URL must be configured and the switch corresponding to this callback protocol activated. For configuration methods, see [Third-party Callback Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34520) document.
- The direction of the callback is from the Room backend to the App backend via an HTTP POST request.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.

## Scenarios

- Pick App user on the seat/Kick user off the seat.
- Lock the seat position.

## Callback Trigger Time
