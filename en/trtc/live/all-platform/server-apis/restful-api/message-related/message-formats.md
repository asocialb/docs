# Message Formats

## MsgBody

Message content is entered in the fields of MsgBody. Tencent Cloud messaged Chat supports multiple message elements in one message, for example, a message can contain both text and emojis. Therefore, MsgBody is defined as an array that can include as many message elements as needed. The name for a message element is TIMMsgElement. For examples of the TIMMsgElements that constitute the MsgBody, see [MsgBody Message Content Examples](#msgbody-examples).

The format of TIMMsgElement is defined as follows:

```
{    "MsgType": "",    "MsgContent": {}}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MsgType | String | The type of the message element. Currently, these message objects are supported: TIMTextElem (text message), TIMLocationElem (location message), TIMFaceElem (emoji message), TIMCustomElem (custom message), TIMSoundElem (audio message), TIMImageElem (image message), TIMFileElem (file message), and TIMVideoFileElem (video message). |
| MsgContent | Object | The content of the message element. Each MsgType has its own MsgContent format. For more information, see below. |

The following table lists the message types (MsgType) that are currently supported:

| Value of MsgType | Type |
| --- | --- |
| TIMTextElem | Text message |
| TIMLocationElem | Geographic location |
| TIMFaceElem | Emoji |
| TIMCustomElem | Custom message. When the receiver is an iOS device and the app is working in the background, this type of message provides fields other than text to APNs. A combined message can contain only one TIMCustomElem custom message element. |
| TIMSoundElem | Voice message |
| TIMImageElem | Image message |
| TIMFileElem | File message |
| TIMVideoFileElem | Video message |

> **Caution:**Messages of the above types can be sent by server-side integrated RESTful APIs.

> **Description:**When a message contains only one `TIMCustomElem` custom message element, if both the `Desc` and `OfflinePushInfo.Desc` fields are not entered, the offline push of the message will not be received, unless the `OfflinePushInfo.Desc` field is entered.

### Custom message element

> **Note:**When a message contains only one TIMCustomElem custom message element, OfflinePushInfo.Desc field requires filling in to receive offline push for the message.

```
{    "MsgType": "TIMCustomElem",     "MsgContent": {        "Data": "message"    }}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data | String | Custom message data. |

### Voice message element

> **Caution:**To send a voice message through the server-side RESTful API, you need to enter the `Url`, `UUID`, and `Download_Flag` fields. Make sure that the voice can be downloaded via the `URL` and the `UUID` is a globally unique string value, usually the MD5 value of the voice file. The message recipient can obtain the specified `UUID` through `V2TIMSoundElem.getUUID()` and the app can use the `UUID` to identify the voice. `Download_Flag` must be set to `2`.

4.X or later versions of Chat SDK (for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows) send voice message elements in the following format:

```
{    "MsgType": "TIMSoundElem",    "MsgContent": {        "Url": "https://1234-5678187359-1253735226.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/abc123/c9be9d32c05bfb77b3edafa4312c6c7d",        "UUID": "1053D4B3D61040894AC3DE44CDF28B3EC7EB7C0F",        "Size": 62351,        "Second": 1,        "Download_Flag": 2    }}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Url | String | Voice download URL, through which the voice content can be downloaded directly. |
| UUID | String | Unique identifier of the voice, key value used by the client to index the voice. |
| Size | Number | Voice data size, in bytes. |
| Second | Number | Voice duration, in seconds. |
| Download_Flag | Number | Flag of the voice download method. Currently, the value of `Download_Flag` must be `2`, which means that the voice content can be downloaded from the URL specified by the `Url` field. |

> **Note:**2.X and 3.X versions of Chat SDK (for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows) send voice message elements in the following format:

```
{    "MsgType": "TIMSoundElem",    "MsgContent": {        "UUID": "305c0201", //Unique identifier of the voice in String type. This is the key value the client uses to index the voice. The voice cannot be downloaded through this field. To obtain the voice, upgrade the Chat SDK to version 4.X.        "Size": 62351,      //Voice data size in bytes, in Number type.        "Second": 1         //Voice duration in seconds, in Number type.    }}
```

### Image message element

> **Caution:**To send an image message through the server-side RESTful API, you need to enter the `URL`, `UUID`, `Width`, and `Height` fields. Make sure that the image can be downloaded via the `URL` so that you can [obtain the basic image information](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/33722) and [process the image](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/33726). `Width` and `Height` are the width and height (unit: pixels) of the image. `UUID` must be set to a globally unique string value, usually the MD5 value of the image. The message recipient can obtain the `V2TIMImage` object by calling `V2TIMImageElem.getImageList()` and then get the specified `UUID` by calling `V2TIMImage.getUUID()`. The app can use the `UUID` to identify the image.

```
{    "MsgType": "TIMImageElem",    "MsgContent": {        "UUID": "1853095_D61040894AC3DE44CDFFFB3EC7EB720F",        "ImageFormat": 1,        "ImageInfoArray": [            {                "Type": 1,           //Original image                "Size": 1853095,                "Width": 2448,                "Height": 3264,                "URL": "http://xxx/3200490432214177468_144115198371610486_D61040894AC3DE44CDFFFB3EC7EB720F/0"            },            {                "Type": 2,      //Large image                "Size": 2565240,                "Width": 0,                "Height": 0,                "URL": "http://xxx/3200490432214177468_144115198371610486_D61040894AC3DE44CDFFFB3EC7EB720F/720"            },            {                "Type": 3,   //Thumbnail                "Size": 12535,                "Width": 0,                "Height": 0,                "URL": "http://xxx/3200490432214177468_144115198371610486_D61040894AC3DE44CDFFFB3EC7EB720F/198"            }        ]    }}

## MsgBody Examples

### Single text element message

A single message contains only one text message element. The text content is **hello world**.

```
{    "MsgBody": [        {            "MsgType": "TIMTextElem",             "MsgContent": {                "Text": "hello world"            }        }    ]}
```

### Combined messages

The following single message contains two text message elements and one emoji message element, in the sequence of text + emoji + text.

```
{    "MsgBody": [        {            "MsgType": "TIMTextElem",             "MsgContent": {                "Text": "hello"            }        },         {            "MsgType": "TIMFaceElem",             "MsgContent": {                "Index": 1,                 "Data": "content"            }        },         {            "MsgType": "TIMTextElem",             "MsgContent": {                "Text": "world"            }        }    ]}
```

> **Caution**A combined message can contain only one `TIMCustomElem` custom message element, and an unlimited number of other message elements.

## Description of Custom Message Data CloudCustomData

Each message can carry custom data `CloudCustomData`.

`CloudCustomData` is saved in the cloud together with the `MsgBody` of the message. It will be sent to the receiver and can still be pulled after the app is uninstalled and reinstalled.

The following example shows the formats of `CloudCustomData` and `MsgBody`:

```
{    "MsgBody": [        {            "MsgType": "TIMTextElem",             "MsgContent": {                "Text": "hello"            }        }    ],    "CloudCustomData": "your cloud custom data"}
```
