# Webhook before Sending Gift

## Feature Description

The App backend can use the callback to determine whether to pass the gift-sending verification in other scenarios.

## Precautions

- Enable callback Configure callback URL and turn on the switch corresponding to this callback. For the configuration method, see [Callback Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/64420).
- The callback direction is from the Live backend to the App backend via an HTTP POST request.
- After receiving a callback request, the App backend needs to verify whether the value of the SDKAppID parameter in the request URL is its own SDKAppID.

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

- App user sends a gift through the client

## Callback Triggering Timing

Before sending a gift.

## API Description

### Sample Request URL

In the following example, the callback URL configured for the App is `https://www.example.com`.

**Example:**

```
https://www.example.com?SdkAppid=$SDKAppID&CallbackCommand=$CallbackCommand&contenttype=json&ClientIP=$ClientIP&OptPlatform=$OptPlatform
```

### Request Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| https | The request protocol is HTTPS, and the request method is POST. |
| www.example.com | Callback URL. |
| SdkAppid | The SDKAppID assigned in the Chat console when creating an application. |
| CallbackCommand | Fixed as Live.CallbackBeforeSendGift. |
| contenttype | The value is fixed as json. |
| ClientIP | Client IP address in the format of 127.0.0.1. |
| OptPlatform | Client platform. For the valid values, see the description of the OptPlatform parameter in Webhook Protocol in [Webhook Overview](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/64412). |

### Sample Request Packet

```
{    "CallbackCommand": "Live.CallbackBeforeSendGift",    "Operator_Account": "brennanli",    "RoomId":"room_id",    "GiftWater": {        "From_Account": "from",        "To_Account": ["to1"],        "Time": 1703589922,        "GiftId": "gift1",        "Count": 1,        "Coins": 1000    }}
```

### Request Packet Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CallbackCommand | String | callback command. |
| Operator_Account | String | Operator UserID who triggered the battle request. |
| RoomId | String | room ID. |
| From_Account | String | gift sender. |
| To_Account | Array | gift recipient. |
| Time | Integer | Timestamp. |
| GiftId | String | gift ID. |
| Count | Integer | gift number. |
| Coins | Integer | gift value. |

### Sample Response Packet

The callback response packet is sent after the App backend synchronizes the data.

```
{    "ActionStatus": "OK",    "ErrorInfo": "",    "ErrorCode": 0}
```

If the App needs to **block gift sending**, set the response packet ErrorCode to non-zero. **If the live backend does not receive the response packet within 2s, gift sending will also be blocked by default.**

If the App needs the **gift sending non-blocking** scenario (if the response packet fails to reply or the live backend does not return the response packet within 2s, it will allow at this point), you can set the [pre-gift callback non-blocking configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/64413).

### Response Packet Fields

| Field | Type | Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ActionStatus | String | Required | Request processing result. OK: processing successful; FAIL: processing failed. |
| ErrorCode | Integer | Required | **0 means agree, 1 means Reject. The error code interval that can be passed through is [102100,102200].** |
| ErrorInfo | String | Required | Error Message. |
