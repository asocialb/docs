# Webhook After Room Destroyed

## Feature Overview

The app backend can use this webhook to monitor room dissolution in real-time, including real-time recording of room dissolution (e.g., logging or synchronization with other systems).

## Notes

- To enable this webhook, you must configure the webhook URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For more information on the configuration method, see [Third party webhook configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/64420) documentation.
- During this webhook, the Live backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the webhook request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.

## Scenarios that may trigger this webhook

- The app user successfully dissolved the room using the client
- The app administrator successfully dissolved the room using the REST API

## Webhook Trigger Time

After the room is successfully destroyed.
