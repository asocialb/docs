# Webhook After Room Metadata Set

## Feature Description

The app server can use this webhook to monitor real-time settings of the room's metadata.

## Must-Knows

- To enable a webhook, you must configure the webhook URL and turn on the switch corresponding to this webhook protocol. For configuration methods, see [Third-Party Webhook Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/64420#) document.
- The direction of the webhook is that the live server initiates an HTTP POST request to the app server.
- After receiving the webhook request, the app server must verify whether the parameter SDKAppID in the request URL is its own SDKAppID.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Webhook

- App users set metadata through the client.
- App admin sets metadata via REST API.

## Timing Of Webhook Occurrence

After the room metadata is set successfully.
