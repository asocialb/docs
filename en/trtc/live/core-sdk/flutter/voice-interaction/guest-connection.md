# Guest Connection

**AtomicXCore** provides [CoGuestStore](https://tencent-rtc.github.io/TUIKit_Flutter/api_live_co_guest_store/CoGuestStore-class.html) and [LiveSeatStore](https://tencent-rtc.github.io/TUIKit_Flutter/api_live_live_seat_store/LiveSeatStore-class.html) modules, used to manage the complete business process of audience mic connection. You donât need to worry about complex state synchronization or signaling interactionsâsimply call a few straightforward methods to add robust audio/video interaction between hosts and viewers in your live broadcast. This guide walks you through how to quickly implement voice mic-link functionality in your iOS app using `CoGuestStore` and `LiveSeatStore`.

## Core Scenarios

`CoGuestStore` and `LiveSeatStore` support the following mainstream scenarios:

- **Audience request to speak**: The audience proactively initiates a mic connection request, and the anchor can grant or reject it upon receiving the request.
- **Anchor invitation to speak**: The anchor can proactively initiate a mic connection invitation to any audience in the live streaming room.
- **Anchor seat management**: The anchor can perform operations such as forced microphone removal, muting, and locking on the user on the seat.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Integrate the Components

Refer to [quick integration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/77561) to integrate **AtomicXCore**.

> **Note:**Before enabling co-hosting features, you must obtain the `liveId` (the unique identifier for the live room) to distinguish between different live rooms. You can get it as follows:**Host**: Specify when creating a live stream via `LiveListStore.shared.createLive(liveInfo)`.**Client**: Get it from `liveInfo` in `LiveListState.liveList.value`, or obtain it by the Anchor sharing the live streaming room ID.

### Step 2: Implement Audience Co-host Application

#### Audience Implementation

As an audience member, your main tasks are **initiating a request, handling the response**, and **leaving the mic proactively**.

1. Submit a co-host application

When the user taps the "Request Mic-Link" button in the UI, call the `applyForSeat` method.

```
import 'package:atomic_x_core/atomicxcore.dart';final String liveId = "room ID";late CoGuestStore guestStore;@overridevoid initState() {  super.initState();  guestStore = CoGuestStore.create(liveId);}// User click "Apply for Mic Connection"Future<void> requestToConnect() async {  // seatIndex: The seat index, starting from 0, represents the applied microphone position. 0 means the first seat. View seat status via LiveSeatState.seatList.value and select an idle seat.  // timeout: Request timeout (seconds). The audience can call cancelApplication to cancel the request to speak within the timeout period.  // The request will expire if it hasn't been processed after reaching the timeout period  final result = await guestStore.applyForSeat(    seatIndex: 0,    timeout: 30,    extraInfo: null,  );  if (result.isSuccess) {    debugPrint('Mic connection request sent, waiting for anchor processing...');  } else {    debugPrint('Failed to send request: ${result.message}');  }}
```

2. **Listen for Host Response**

By adding `GuestListener`, you can receive the host's response

```
late GuestListener _guestListener;// Subscribe to events when your Widget initializesvoid subscribeGuestEvents() {  _guestListener = GuestListener(    onGuestApplicationResponded: (isAccept, hostUser) {      if (isAccept) {        debugPrint('Anchor ${hostUser.userName} granted your request, preparing to join the mic');        // 1. Turn on microphone        // DeviceStore is the device management module provided by AtomicXCore, used for managing microphones, cameras and other physical devices.        // When the host agrees to connect mic, turn on microphone to start collecting audio.        DeviceStore.shared.openLocalMicrophone();        // 2. Update UI herein, such as disabling the apply button and displaying the mic connection state      } else {        debugPrint('Anchor ${hostUser.userName} refused your request');        // Pop-up prompts user that the application was rejected      }    },  );  guestStore.addGuestListener(_guestListener);}@overridevoid dispose() {  guestStore.removeGuestListener(_guestListener);  super.dispose();}
```

3. **Leave Seat**

When an audience member on mic wants to end the interaction, call `disConnect` to return to regular audience status.

```
// User click "Disconnect" buttonFuture<void> leaveSeat() async {  final result = await guestStore.disconnect();  if (result.isSuccess) {    debugPrint('Disconnected successfully');  } else {    debugPrint('Failed to leave the seat: ${result.message}');  }}
```

4. **(Optional) Cancel Request**

If the audience member wants to withdraw the request before the host responds, call `cancelApplication`.

```
// While waiting, the user clicks "Cancel Application"Future<void> cancelApplication() async {  final result = await guestStore.cancelApplication();  if (result.isSuccess) {    debugPrint('Request canceled');  } else {    debugPrint('Failed to cancel request: ${result.message}');  }}
```

#### Host Implementation

As the host, your main tasks are **receiving requests, displaying the request list**, and **handling requests**.

1. **Listen for New Co-host Applications**

By adding `HostListener`, you can receive immediate notification when a new audience applies and prompt.

```
import 'package:atomic_x_core/atomicxcore.dart';final String liveId = "room ID";late CoGuestStore guestStore;late HostListener _hostListener;@overridevoid initState() {  super.initState();  guestStore = CoGuestStore.create(liveId);  // Subscribe to anchor event  _hostListener = HostListener(    onGuestApplicationReceived: (guestUser) {      debugPrint('Received mic connection request from audience ${guestUser.userName}');      // Update the UI here, for example display a red dot on the "application list" button    },  );  guestStore.addHostListener(_hostListener);}@overridevoid dispose() {  guestStore.removeHostListener(_hostListener);  super.dispose();}
```

2. **Display Request List**

`CoGuestStore`'s `coGuestState` maintains the current applicant list in real time. You can subscribe to it to update your UI.

```
late final VoidCallback _applicantsListener = _onApplicantsChanged;// Subscribe to status changevoid subscribeApplicants() {  guestStore.coGuestState.applicants.addListener(_applicantsListener);}void _onApplicantsChanged() {  final applicants = guestStore.coGuestState.applicants.value;  debugPrint('Current number of applicants: ${applicants.length}');  // Update your "applicant list" UI here}@overridevoid dispose() {  guestStore.coGuestState.applicants.removeListener(_applicantsListener);  super.dispose();}
```

3. **Handle Co-host Requests**

When you select an audience member from the list and tap "Accept" or "Reject", call the corresponding method.

```
// Anchor clicks the "Grant" button and imports the applicant's userIDFuture<void> accept(String userId) async {  final result = await guestStore.acceptApplication(userId);  if (result.isSuccess) {    debugPrint('Approved $userId\\'s request, the other party is joining the mic');  }}// Anchor clicks the "Reject" buttonFuture<void> reject(String userId) async {  final result = await guestStore.rejectApplication(userId);  if (result.isSuccess) {    debugPrint('$userId\\'s application denied');  }}
```

### Step 3: Host Invites Audience to Co-host

#### Host Implementation

1. I**nvite audience to co-host**

When the host selects a viewer from the audience list and taps "Invite to Mic", call the `inviteToSeat` method.

```
// Anchor selects audience and initiates invitationFuture<void> invite(String userId) async {  // inviteeID: The ID of the invitee, seatIndex: The seat index, timeout: The invitation timeout duration  final result = await guestStore.inviteToSeat(    inviteeID: userId,    seatIndex: 0,    timeout: 30,    extraInfo: null,  );  if (result.isSuccess) {    debugPrint('Sent invitation to $userId, waiting for peer response...');  }}
```

2. **Listen for Audience Response**

Listen to the `onHostInvitationResponded` event via `HostListener`.

```
// Add to the HostListener configuration_hostListener = HostListener(  onHostInvitationResponded: (isAccept, guestUser) {    if (isAccept) {      debugPrint('Audience ${guestUser.userName} accepted your invitation');    } else {      debugPrint('Audience ${guestUser.userName} refused your invitation');    }  },);
```

#### Audience Implementation

1. **Receive Host Invitation**

Listen to the `onHostInvitationReceived` event via `GuestListener`.

```
// Add to the GuestListener configuration_guestListener = GuestListener(  onHostInvitationReceived: (hostUser) {    debugPrint('Received mic connection invitation from Anchor ${hostUser.userName}');    // Pop up a dialog box for user selection between "Accept" or "Reject"    // showInvitationDialog(hostUser);  },);
```

2. **Respond to invitation**

After the user makes a selection in the pop-up dialog box, call the method accordingly.

```
final String inviterId = "anchor ID who initiates invitation"; // obtain from onHostInvitationReceived event// User clicks "Accept"Future<void> accept() async {  final result = await guestStore.acceptInvitation(inviterId);  if (result.isSuccess) {    // Turn the mic on    // DeviceStore is the device management module provided by AtomicXCore, used for managing microphones, cameras and other physical devices.    // After accepting the invitation, turn on microphone to start collecting audio    DeviceStore.shared.openLocalMicrophone();  }}// User click "Reject"Future<void> reject() async {  await guestStore.rejectInvitation(inviterId);}
```

## Advanced Features

Once a user is on mic, the host may need to manage mic seats. The following features are primarily provided by `LiveSeatStore`, which functions with `CoGuestStore`.

### Microphone Control: DeviceStore vs LiveSeatStore

When working with seat features, itâs important to understand the difference between `DeviceStore` and `LiveSeatStore` for microphone control:

- **DeviceStore**: Manage physical devices. `openLocalMicrophone` starts up the microphone device to perform audio capture. `closeLocalMicrophone` stops audio capture and releases the microphone device.
- **LiveSeatStore**: Manages seat business (i.e., audio stream). `muteMicrophone` mutes and stops sending local audio stream to the remote end, but the microphone device itself keeps running. `unmuteMicrophone` unmutes and restores sending audio stream to the remote end.

**Recommended workflow**: You should follow the principle of "open the device only once and use the mute switch for Anchor."

1. **When going on stage**: Once the audience succeeds in going on stage, call `openLocalMicrophone` only once to start the device.
2. **When on stage**: For all "unmute" and "mute" operations on the seat, users should call `unmuteMicrophone` and `muteMicrophone` to control the upstream audio stream.
3. **When going off stage**: When a user goes off stage (such as calling `disconnect`), call `closeLocalMicrophone` to release the device.

### Microphone Mute/Unmute for Users on Seat

Users on seat (including the anchor) can mute or unmute their own microphone using methods provided by `LiveSeatStore`.

#### Implementation:

1. **Mute**: Call the `muteMicrophone()` method. This is a one-way request with no callback.
2. **Unmute**: Call the `unmuteMicrophone()` method.

#### Example:

```
final seatStore = LiveSeatStore.create(liveId);seatStore.muteMicrophone(); // Muteawait seatStore.unmuteMicrophone(); // Unmute
```

### Host Remotely Controls Userâs Microphone

The anchor can forcibly mute users on seat or invite them to unmute.

#### Implementation:

1. **Force Mute (Lock)**: The host calls `closeRemoteMicrophone` to forcibly mute the target user's microphone and lock their mic control. The muted user will receive the `onLocalMicrophoneClosedByAdmin` event via `liveSeatEventPublisher`, and their local "Open Microphone" button should become disabled.
2. **Invite to Unmute (Unlock)**: The host calls `openRemoteMicrophone`âthis does not forcibly open the user's mic, but unlocks their mic control, allowing them to unmute themselves. The target user receives the `onLocalMicrophoneOpenedByAdmin` event, their "Open Microphone" button should become enabled, but they remain muted until they unmute themselves.
3. **User Unmutes Themselves**: After receiving the unlock notification, the user must actively call `LiveSeatStore`'s `unmuteMicrophone()` to actually unmute and be heard in the room.

#### Example:

##### Host Side:

```
final seatStore = LiveSeatStore.create(liveId);final String targetUserId = "userD";// 1. Force mute userD and lockfinal result1 = await seatStore.closeRemoteMicrophone(targetUserId);if (result1.isSuccess) {  debugPrint('Muted and locked $targetUserId');}// 2. Unlock userD's microphone permission (at this point userD remains muted)final result2 = await seatStore.openRemoteMicrophone(  userID: targetUserId,  policy: DeviceControlPolicy.unlockOnly,);if (result2.isSuccess) {  debugPrint('Unlocked $targetUserId\\'s microphone, user can unmute manually');}
```

##### Audience Side:

```
late LiveSeatListener _seatListener;// userD listens to the Anchor's operationvoid subscribeSeatEvents() {  _seatListener = LiveSeatListener(    onLocalMicrophoneClosedByAdmin: () {      debugPrint('Muted by anchor');      // muteButton.isEnabled = false;    },    onLocalMicrophoneOpenedByAdmin: (policy) {      debugPrint('Anchor unmuted and unlocked');      // muteButton.isEnabled = true;      // muteButton.text = "Turn on microphone";    },  );  seatStore.addLiveSeatEventListener(_seatListener);}@overridevoid dispose() {  seatStore.removeLiveSeatEventListener(_seatListener);  super.dispose();}
```

#### CloseRemoteMicrophone API Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `userID` | `String` | Operating user `userID`. |

#### OpenRemoteMicrophone API Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `userID` | `String` | Operating user `userID`. |
| `policy` | `DeviceControlPolicy` | Turn on microphone policy. |

### Host Removes On-Mic User from the Seat

#### Implementation:

1. **Remove User from Mic**: The anchor can call the `kickUserOutOfSeat` method to force the specified user off the mic.
2. **Listen for Event Notification**: Users kicked off the mic will receive the `GuestListener` `onKickedOffSeat` event notification.

#### Example:

```
// Assume "userB" is to be kicked outfinal String targetUserId = "userB";final result = await seatStore.kickUserOutOfSeat(targetUserId);if (result.isSuccess) {  debugPrint('Kicked $targetUserId off the mic');} else {  debugPrint('Kick user failed: ${result.message}');}// "userB" received the kicked off the mic event_guestListener = GuestListener(  onKickedOffSeat: (seatIndex, hostUser) {    // Show a toast notification    debugPrint('You have been kicked off the mic by anchor');  },);
```

#### KickUserOutOfSeat API Parameter

| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `userID` | `String` | The user kicked off the mic `userID`. |

### Host Locks and Unlocks Mic Seats

The host can lock or unlock a specific mic seat.

#### Implementation:

1. **Lock Seat**: The anchor can call the `lockSeat` method to lock the seat with a specified index. Once locked, audiences cannot use `applyForSeat` or `takeSeat` to occupy the seat, but the anchor can invite an audience to the locked seat via `inviteToSeat`.
2. **Unlock Seat**: Call `unlockSeat` to unlock the seat. The seat can be occupied again after unlocking.

#### Example:

```
// Lock seat 2final result1 = await seatStore.lockSeat(2);if (result1.isSuccess) {  debugPrint('Seat 2 locked');}// Unlock seat 2final result2 = await seatStore.unlockSeat(2);if (result2.isSuccess) {  debugPrint('Seat 2 unlocked');}
```

#### LockSeat API Parameter

| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `seatIndex` | `int` | Index of the mic to lock. |

#### UnlockSeat API Parameter

| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `seatIndex` | `int` | Index of the mic to unlock. |

### Move User to Another Seat

Host and co-host can call `moveUserToSeat` to change seat positions.

#### Implementation:

1. **Host Moves User to Mic Seat**: The host can call this API to move any user to a specified seat. At this point, `userID` is the ID of the target user, `targetIndex` is the index of the target seat, and the `policy` parameter specifies the move strategy if the target seat is occupied. For details, see the [API parameter](#moveusertoseat-.E6.8E.A5.E5.8F.A3.E5.8F.82.E6.95.B0.EF.BC.9A) description.
2. **On-Mic User Moves Themselves**: On-mic users can also call this API to move themselves. In this case, `userID` must be the user's own ID, `targetIndex` is the desired new seat index, and the `policy` parameter is ignored. If the target seat is occupied, the move fails with an error.

#### Example code:

```
final result = await seatStore.moveUserToSeat(  userID: "userC",  targetIndex: newSeatIndex,  policy: MoveSeatPolicy.abortWhenOccupied,);if (result.isSuccess) {  debugPrint('Successfully moved to seat $newSeatIndex');} else {  debugPrint('Seat change failed, possibly seat is occupied');}
```

#### MoveUserToSeat API Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `userID` | `String` | The user who needs to move the mic `userID`. |
| `targetIndex` | `int` | Index of the target seat. |
| `policy` | `MoveSeatPolicy` | Processing policy when the target seat is occupied`abortWhenOccupied`: Abort movement when the target seat is occupied (default policy)`forceReplace`: Forcibly replace the user on the target seat. The replaced user will be kicked off the mic.`swapPosition`: Exchange with the user on the target seat. |

## FAQs

### What are the differences between voice room co-hosting and video live co-hosting?

The main difference between both lies in business form and UI display:

- **Video live streaming:** The focus is on video display. Use `LiveCoreWidget` as the main component to render the anchor and guest video streams. The UI emphasizes video layout and sizing, and you can use `VideoViewDelegate` to add overlays (such as nicknames or placeholders). Both camera and microphone can be enabled.
- **Voice room (chat room):** The focus is on the seat grid. You do not use `LiveCoreWidget`, but instead build a grid UI (such as `GridView`) based on the `liveSeatState` of `LiveSeatStore` (especially seatList). The UI displays each seatâs `SeatInfo` status in real time: whether itâs occupied, muted, locked, or currently speaking. Only the microphone needs to be enabled.

### How do I update seat info in the UI in real time?

You should subscribe to the `seatList` property in `LiveSeatState`, which is a responsive data of `ValueListenable<List<SeatInfo>>` data type. It will notify you to re-render the microphone position list whenever the array changes. By traversing this array, you can:

- Get user information on the seat through `seatInfo.userInfo`.
- Check whether the seat is locked through `seatInfo.isLocked`.
- Check the mic status of the on-mic user through `seatInfo.userInfo.microphoneStatus`.
