## Core Scenarios

`CoGuestStore` and `LiveSeatStore` support the following core live interaction scenarios:

- **Audience Request to Join Mic**: Viewers can actively request to join the mic; the host can approve or reject these requests.
- **Host Invites Audience to Mic**: The host can proactively invite any viewer in the live room to join the mic.
- **Host Manages Mic Seats**: The host can manage users on mic seats, including removing users, muting, and locking seats.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Component Integration

Refer to the [Quick Start](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/74682) to integrate **AtomicXCore**.

### Step 2: Implement Audience Mic-Link Request

#### Audience Side Implementation

As an audience member, your main tasks are **initiating a request, handling the response**, and **leaving the mic proactively**.

1. **Initiate Mic-Link Request**

When the user taps the "Request Mic-Link" button in the UI, call the `applyForSeat` method.

```
import AtomicXCorelet liveId = "Room ID"var guestStore: CoGuestStore {    CoGuestStore.create(liveID: liveID)}// User taps "Request Mic-Link"func requestToConnect() {    // timeout: Request timeout, e.g., 30 seconds    guestStore.applyForSeat(timeout: 30.0, extraInfo: nil) { result in      switch result {      case .success():          print("Mic-link request sent, waiting for host response...")      case .failure(let error):          print("Failed to send request: \\(error.message)")      }    }}
```

2. **Listen for Host Response**

Subscribe to `guestEventPublisher` to receive the hostâs response.

```
import AtomicXCoreimport Combine// Subscribe to events during view controller initializationfunc subscribeGuestEvents() {    guestStore.guestEventPublisher      .sink { [weak self] event in          if case let .onGuestApplicationResponded(isAccept, hostUser) = event {              if isAccept {                  print("Host \\(hostUser.userName) accepted your request, preparing to join mic")                  // 1. Open microphone                  DeviceStore.shared.openLocalMicrophone(completion: nil)                  // 2. Update UI, e.g., disable request button, show "on mic" status              } else {                  print("Host \\(hostUser.userName) rejected your request")                  // Show popup to inform user of rejection              }          }      }      .store(in: &cancellables) // Manage subscription lifecycle}
```

3. **Leave Mic Proactively**

When an audience member on mic wants to end the interaction, call `disConnect` to return to regular audience status.

```
// User taps "Leave Mic" buttonfunc leaveSeat() {    guestStore.disConnect { result in      switch result {      case .success():          print("Successfully left mic")      case .failure(let error):          print("Failed to leave mic: \\(error.message)")      }    }}
```

4. **(Optional) Cancel Request**

If the audience member wants to withdraw the request before the host responds, call `cancelApplication`.

```
// User taps "Cancel Request" while waitingfunc cancelRequest() {    guestStore.cancelApplication { result in      switch result {      case .success():          print("Request cancelled")      case .failure(let error):          print("Failed to cancel request: \\(error.message)")      }    }}
```

#### Host Side Implementation

As the host, your main tasks are **receiving requests, displaying the request list**, and **handling requests**.

1. **Listen for New Mic-Link Requests**

Subscribe to `hostEventPublisher` to be notified immediately when a new audience request arrives.

```
import AtomicXCoreimport Combinelet liveId = "Room ID"var guestStore: CoGuestStore {    CoGuestStore.create(liveID: liveID)}// Subscribe to host eventsguestStore.hostEventPublisher    .sink { [weak self] event in        if case let .onGuestApplicationReceived(guestUser) = event {            print("Received mic-link request from audience \\(guestUser.userName)")            // Update UI, e.g., show a red dot on the "Request List" button        }    }    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

2. **Display Request List**

The `CoGuestStore` state maintains the current list of applicants in real time. Subscribe to it to refresh your UI.

```
import AtomicXCoreimport Combine// Subscribe to state changesguestStore.state    .subscribe(StatePublisherSelector(keyPath: \\CoGuestState.applicants)) // Only care about applicant list changes    .removeDuplicates()    .sink { applicants in        print("Current number of applicants: \\(applicants.count)")        // Refresh your "Applicant List" UI here        // self.applicantListView.update(with: applicants)    }    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

3. **Handle Mic-Link Requests**

When you select an audience member from the list and tap "Accept" or "Reject", call the corresponding method.

```
// Host taps "Accept" button, passing applicant's userIDfunc accept(userId: String) {    guestStore.acceptApplication(userID: userId) { result in        if case .success = result {            print("Accepted \\(userId)'s request, they are joining the mic")        }    }}// Host taps "Reject" buttonfunc reject(userId: String) {    guestStore.rejectApplication(userID: userId) { result in        if case .success = result {            print("Rejected \\(userId)'s request")        }    }}
```

### Step 3: Implement Host-Initiated Mic-Link Invitation

#### Host Side Implementation

1. **Invite Audience to Mic**

When the host selects a viewer from the audience list and taps "Invite to Mic", call the `inviteToSeat` method.

```
// Host selects audience and initiates invitationfunc invite(userId: String) {    // timeout: Invitation timeout    guestStore.inviteToSeat(userID: userId, timeout: 30.0, extraInfo: nil) { result in        if case .success = result {            print("Invitation sent to \\(userId), waiting for response...")        }    }}
```

2. **Listen for Audience Response**

Listen for the `onHostInvitationResponded` event via `hostEventPublisher`.

```
// Add to hostEventPublisher subscriptionif case let .onHostInvitationResponded(isAccept, guestUser) = event {    if isAccept {        print("Audience \\(guestUser.userName) accepted your invitation")    } else {        print("Audience \\(guestUser.userName) rejected your invitation")    }}
```

#### Audience Side Implementation

1. **Receive Host Invitation**

Listen for the `onHostInvitationReceived` event via `guestEventPublisher`.

```
// Add to guestEventPublisher subscriptionif case let .onHostInvitationReceived(hostUser) = event {    print("Received mic-link invitation from host \\(hostUser.userName)")    // Show a dialog for the user to choose "Accept" or "Reject"    // self.showInvitationDialog(from: hostUser)}
```

2. **Respond to Invitation**

When the user makes a choice in the dialog, call the corresponding method.

```
let inviterId = "Host ID who sent the invitation" // Get from onHostInvitationReceived event// User taps "Accept"func accept() {    guestStore.acceptInvitation(inviterID: inviterId) { result in        if case .success = result {            // 2. Open microphone            DeviceStore.shared.openLocalMicrophone(completion: nil)        }    }}// User taps "Reject"func reject() {    guestStore.rejectInvitation(inviterID: inviterId) { result in        // ...    }}
```

## Advanced Features

Once a user is on mic, the host may need to manage mic seats. The following features are primarily provided by `LiveSeatStore`, which functions with `CoGuestStore`.

### On-Mic Users Control Their Own Microphone

On-mic users (including the host) can control their own microphone mute status via the `LiveSeatStore` interface.

#### Implementation:

1. **Mute:** Call `muteMicrophone()`. This is a one-way request with no callback.
2. **Unmute:** Call `unmuteMicrophone(completion:)`.

#### Example Code:

```
let seatStore = LiveSeatStore.create(liveID: liveId)seatStore.muteMicrophone() // MuteseatStore.unmuteMicrophone(completion: nil) // Unmute
```

#### unmuteMicrophone Parameters:

| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `completion` | `CompletionClosure?` | Callback after the operation completes. |

### Host Remotely Controls On-Mic Userâs Microphone

The host can perform "force mute" or "invite to unmute" operations on other on-mic users.

#### Implementation:

1. **Force Mute (Lock):** The host calls `closeRemoteMicrophone` to forcibly mute the target user's microphone and lock their mic control. The muted user will receive the `onLocalMicrophoneClosedByAdmin` event via `liveSeatEventPublisher`, and their local "Open Microphone" button should become disabled.
2. **Invite to Unmute (Unlock):** The host calls `openRemoteMicrophone`âthis does not forcibly open the user's mic, but unlocks their mic control, allowing them to unmute themselves. The target user receives the `onLocalMicrophoneOpenedByAdmin` event, their "Open Microphone" button should become enabled, but they remain muted until they unmute themselves.
3. **User Unmutes Themselves:** After receiving the unlock notification, the user must actively call `LiveSeatStore`'s `unmuteMicrophone()` to actually unmute and be heard in the room.

#### Example Code:

##### Host Side:

```
let targetUserId = "userD"// 1. Force mute and lock userDseatStore.closeRemoteMicrophone(userID: targetUserId) { result in    if case .success = result {        print("\\(targetUserId) has been muted and locked")    }}// 2. Unlock userDâs microphone control (userD remains muted)seatStore.openRemoteMicrophone(userID: targetUserId, policy: .unlockOnly) { result in     if case .success = result {        print("Invited \\(targetUserId) to open microphone (unlocked)")    }}
```

##### Audience Side:

```
// userD listens for host actionsseatStore.liveSeatEventPublisher    .sink { event in        switch event {        case .onLocalMicrophoneClosedByAdmin:            print("Muted by host")            // self.muteButton.isEnabled = false        case .onLocalMicrophoneOpenedByAdmin(policy: _):             print("Host unlocked mute control")            // self.muteButton.isEnabled = true            // self.muteButton.setTitle("Open Microphone")        default:            break        }    }    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

#### closeRemoteMicrophone Parameters:

| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `userID` | `String` | The userID of the target user. |
| `completion` | `CompletionClosure?` | Callback after the request completes. |

#### openRemoteMicrophone Parameters:

| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `userID` | `String` | The userID of the target user. |
| `completion` | `CompletionClosure?` | Callback after the request completes. |

### Host Removes On-Mic User from the Seat

#### Implementation:

1. **Remove User from Mic:** The host can call `kickUserOutOfSeat` to forcibly remove a specified user from the mic seat.
2. **Listen for Event Notification:** The removed user will receive the `onKickedOffSeat` event via `CoGuestStore.guestEventPublisher`.

#### Example Code:

```
// Suppose you want to remove "userB"let targetUserId = "userB"seatStore.kickUserOutOfSeat(userID: targetUserId) { result in    switch result {    case .success:        print("\\(targetUserId) has been removed from the mic seat")    case .failure(let error):        print("Failed to remove user: \\(error.message)")    }}// "userB" receives the removal eventguestStore    .guestEventPublisher    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)    .sink { [weak self] event in        guard let self = self else { return }        switch event {        case .onKickedOffSeat(seatIndex: _, hostUser: _):            // Show toast notification        default:            break        }    }    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

#### kickUserOutOfSeat Parameters:

| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `userID` | `String` | The userID of the user to be removed from the mic seat. |
| `completion` | `CompletionClosure?` | Callback after the request completes. |

### Host Locks and Unlocks Mic Seats

The host can lock or unlock a specific mic seat.

#### Implementation:

1. **Lock Seat:** The host can call `lockSeat` to lock the seat at the specified index. Once locked, audience members cannot occupy this seat via `applyForSeat` or `takeSeat`.
2. **Unlock Seat:** Call `unlockSeat` to unlock the seat, making it available again.

#### Example Code:

```
// Lock seat #2seatStore.lockSeat(seatIndex: 2) { result in    if case .success = result {        print("Seat #2 locked")    }}// Unlock seat #2seatStore.unlockSeat(seatIndex: 2) { result in    if case .success = result {        print("Seat #2 unlocked")    }}
```

#### lockSeat Parameters:

| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `seatIndex` | `Int` | Index of the seat to lock. |
| `completion` | `CompletionClosure?` | Callback after the request completes. |

#### unlockSeat Parameters:

| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `seatIndex` | `Int` | Index of the seat to unlock. |
| `completion` | `CompletionClosure?` | Callback after the request completes. |

### Move Mic Seats

Hosts and on-mic users can call `moveUserToSeat(userID:targetIndex:policy:completion:)` to move users between mic seats.

#### Implementation:

1. **Host Moves User to Mic Seat:** The host can use this API to move any user to a specified mic seat. Provide the target user's `userID`, the target seat index as `targetIndex`, and use the `policy` parameter to specify the seat movement strategy if the target seat is occupied (see parameter details below).
2. **On-Mic User Moves Themselves:** On-mic users can also call this API to move themselves. In this case, `userID` must be the user's own ID, `targetIndex` is the desired new seat index, and the `policy` parameter is ignored. If the target seat is occupied, the move fails with an error.

#### Example Code:

```
seatStore.moveUserToSeat(userID: "userC",                         targetIndex: newSeatIndex,                         policy: .abortWhenOccupied) { result in    if case .success = result {        print("Successfully moved to seat #\\(newSeatIndex)")    } else {        print("Move failed, seat may be occupied")    }}
```

#### moveUserToSeat Parameters:

| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `userID` | `String` | The userID of the user to move. |
| `targetIndex` | `Int` | Target seat index. |
| `policy` | `MoveSeatPolicy?` | Seat movement policy if the target seat is occupied:<br>- `abortWhenOccupied`: Abort move if seat is occupied (default)<br>- `forceReplace`: Force replace the user on the target seat; replaced user will be removed<br>- `swapPosition`: Swap positions with the user on the target seat. |
| `completion` | `CompletionClosure?` | Callback after the request completes. |

## FAQs

### Whatâs the difference between voice room mic-link and video live mic-link implementation?

The main differences are in business logic and UI presentation:

- `Video Live: `The core is the video feed. Use `LiveCoreView` as the main component to render video streams for the host and mic-linked viewers. The UI focuses on video layout and sizing, and you can add overlays (nickname, placeholder image) via `VideoViewDelegate`. Both camera and microphone can be enabled.
- `Voice Room:` The core is the mic seat grid. Do not use `LiveCoreView`; instead, build a grid UI (e.g., `UICollectionView`) based on the `LiveSeatStore`'s `state` (especially `seatList`). The UI focuses on real-time display of each seatâs `SeatInfo` status: occupied, muted, locked, and speaking status. Only the microphone needs to be enabled.

### How do I refresh mic seat info (e.g., occupied, muted) in the UI in real time?

Subscribe to the `seatList` property in `LiveSeatState`, which is a reactive `[SeatInfo]` array. Any changes will notify you to re-render the mic seat list. Iterate through this array to:

- Get user info on each seat via `seatInfo.userInfo`.
- Check if a seat is locked via `seatInfo.isLocked`.
- Check mic status of the user via `seatInfo.userInfo.microphoneStatus`.

### Whatâs the difference between microphone interfaces in LiveSeatStore and DeviceStore?

This is an important distinction. `DeviceStore` manages the physical device, while `LiveSeatStore` manages mic seat business logic (audio stream).

`DeviceStore`:

- `openLocalMicrophone`: Requests system permission and starts the microphone hardware for audio capture. This is a time-consuming operation.
- `closeLocalMicrophone`: Stops audio capture and releases the microphone device.

`LiveSeatStore`:

- `muteMicrophone`: Mute. Stops sending local audio stream to remote, but the microphone hardware remains running.
- `unmuteMicrophone`: Unmute. Resumes sending audio stream to remote.

**Recommended workflow:**"Open the device once, control mute/unmute while on mic"

1. **When joining mic:** When an audience member successfully joins the mic, call `openLocalMicrophone` once to start the device.
2. **While on mic:** All "mute" and "unmute" actions while on mic should use `muteMicrophone` and `unmuteMicrophone` to control the audio stream.
3. **When leaving mic:** When leaving mic (e.g., calling `disconnect`), call `closeLocalMicrophone` to release the device.
