# Guest Connection

**AtomicXCore** provides the [CoGuestState](https://web.sdk.qcloud.com/trtc/live/web/doc/en/index.html#module-CoGuestState) module, purpose-built to manage the entire workflow for audience guest connections in live streaming scenarios. You donât need to handle complex state synchronization or signaling logic yourselfâjust call a few simple methods to enable seamless audio/video interaction between your hosts and audience.

## Core Scenarios

`CoGuestState` covers the two most common guest connection workflows:

- **Audience Request to Join**: Audience members can actively request to join the stream as a guest. The host can accept or reject these requests.
- **Host Invites Audience to Join**: The host can invite any audience member in the live room to join as a guest.

## Sample Project

Check out our [CoGuestPanel](https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/TUIKit_Vue3/blob/main/packages/tuikit-atomicx-vue3/src/components/CoGuestPanel/CoGuestPanel.vue) component on GitHub for a full implementation example.

## Implementation

### Component Integration

Follow the [Quick Start Guide](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/74840) to integrate **AtomicXCore** and set up `LiveCoreView`.

> **Noteï¼**Before proceeding, make sure you have created or joined a room as described in the [Quick Start Guide](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/74840). Then, continue with the steps below.

### Audience Request to Join

#### Audience Implementation

As an audience member, youâll need to submit a guest request, handle the hostâs response, and disconnect when needed.

##### **Initiate a Co-hosting Request**

Call the `applyForSeat` method when the user clicks the "Request to Join" button in your UI.

```
import { useCoGuestState } from "tuikit-atomicx-vue3";const { applyForSeat } = useCoGuestState();// User clicks "Request to Join"const handleRequestToConnect = async () => {    try {        await applyForSeat({           seatIndex: -1, // -1 assigns a seat randomly          timeout: 30,   // Timeout in seconds; if TS expects ms, use 30000        });        console.log('Request sent');    } catch (error) {        console.error('Request failed', error);    }}
```

##### Handle Host Response

Subscribe to the `CoGuestEvent.onGuestApplicationResponded` event with `subscribeEvent` to receive the hostâs decision.

```
import { onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue';import { useCoGuestState, useDeviceState, CoGuestEvent } from "tuikit-atomicx-vue3";const { subscribeEvent, unsubscribeEvent } = useCoGuestState();const { openLocalMicrophone, openLocalCamera } = useDeviceState();const handleGuestApplicationResponded = (eventInfo: any) => {    if (eventInfo.isAccept) {        console.log('Guest request accepted');        // Enable microphone and camera        openLocalMicrophone();        openLocalCamera();        // Update UI to indicate guest connection is active    } else {        console.log('Guest request rejected');        // Notify user that the request was rejected    }};onMounted(() => {    subscribeEvent(CoGuestEvent.onGuestApplicationResponded, handleGuestApplicationResponded);});onUnmounted(() => {    unsubscribeEvent(CoGuestEvent.onGuestApplicationResponded, handleGuestApplicationResponded);});
```

##### Disconnect from Guest Mode

When a guest wants to leave, call the `disConnect` method to return to audience status.

```
import { useCoGuestState } from "tuikit-atomicx-vue3";const { disConnect } = useCoGuestState();// User clicks "Leave Seat"const leaveSeat = async () => {    try {        await disConnect();        console.log('Disconnected successfully');    } catch (error) {        console.log('Disconnect failed', error);    }}
```

##### Cancel a Pending Request (Optional)

If the audience member wants to withdraw their request before the host responds, use `cancelApplication`.

```
import { useCoGuestState } from "tuikit-atomicx-vue3";const { cancelApplication } = useCoGuestState();// User clicks "Cancel Request" while waitingconst handleCancelRequest = async () => {    await cancelApplication();    console.log('Request cancelled successfully');}
```

#### Host Implementation

As the host, youâll need to listen for incoming requests, display the request list, and handle each request.

##### Listen for New Guest Requests

Subscribe to the `CoHostEvent.onGuestApplicationReceived` event to get notified when an audience member requests to join.

```
import { onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue';import { useCoGuestState, CoHostEvent } from "tuikit-atomicx-vue3";const { subscribeEvent, unsubscribeEvent } = useCoGuestState();const handleGuestApplicationReceived = (eventInfo: any) => {    console.log('Received guest request from audience:', eventInfo.guestUser);    // Update UI, e.g., show a notification badge on the "Request List" button};onMounted(() => {    subscribeEvent(CoHostEvent.onGuestApplicationReceived, handleGuestApplicationReceived);});onUnmounted(() => {    unsubscribeEvent(CoHostEvent.onGuestApplicationReceived, handleGuestApplicationReceived);});
```

##### Display the Request List

`CoGuestState` provides a real-time list of applicants via the `applicants` Vue `ComputedRef`. Each applicant includes fields like `userId` and `userName`. Use this directly in your template:

```
<template>    <div v-for="audience in applicants" :key="audience.userId" class="applicant-item">      <span>{{ audience.userName }}</span>      <button @click="handleAccept(audience.userId)">Accept</button>      <button @click="handleReject(audience.userId)">Reject</button>    </div></template><script setup lang="ts">import { useCoGuestState } from "tuikit-atomicx-vue3";const { applicants, acceptApplication, rejectApplication } = useCoGuestState();const handleAccept = async (userId: string) => {    await acceptApplication({ userId });};const handleReject = async (userId: string) => {    await rejectApplication({ userId });};</script>
```

### Host Invites Audience to Join

#### Host Implementation

##### Invite an Audience Member

When the host selects an audience member and clicks "Invite to Join", call `inviteToSeat`.

```
import { useCoGuestState } from "tuikit-atomicx-vue3";const { inviteToSeat } = useCoGuestState();// Host selects an audience member and sends an invitationconst handleInviteToSeat = async (userId: string) => {    try {        await inviteToSeat({            userId,            seatIndex: -1, // Assign seat randomly            timeout: 30,        });        console.log(`Sent guest invitation to audience ${userId}`);    } catch (error) {        console.error('Invitation failed', error);    }}
```

##### Handle Audience Response

Subscribe to the `CoHostEvent.onHostInvitationResponded` event to track whether the audience member accepts or rejects the invitation.

```
import { onMounted } from 'vue';import { useCoGuestState, CoHostEvent } from "tuikit-atomicx-vue3";const { subscribeEvent } = useCoGuestState();onMounted(() => {    subscribeEvent(CoHostEvent.onHostInvitationResponded, (eventInfo) => {        if(eventInfo.isAccept){            console.log(`Audience ${eventInfo.guestUser.userName} accepted your invitation`);        } else {            console.log(`Audience ${eventInfo.guestUser.userName} rejected your invitation`);        }    });});
```

#### Audience Implementation

##### Receive Host Invitation

Subscribe to the `CoGuestEvent.onHostInvitationReceived` event to detect when the host sends an invitation.

```
import { onMounted } from 'vue';import { useCoGuestState, CoGuestEvent } from "tuikit-atomicx-vue3";const { subscribeEvent } = useCoGuestState();onMounted(() => {    subscribeEvent(CoGuestEvent.onHostInvitationReceived, (eventInfo) => {        // Show a modal dialog for the user to accept or reject        // Save eventInfo.hostUser.userId as inviterId        showInviteDialog(eventInfo.hostUser.userId);    });});
```

##### Respond to Invitation

When the user chooses to accept or reject in the dialog, call the appropriate method.

```
import { useCoGuestState, useDeviceState } from "tuikit-atomicx-vue3";const { acceptInvitation, rejectInvitation } = useCoGuestState();const { openLocalMicrophone, openLocalCamera } = useDeviceState();// User clicks "Accept"const handleAccept = async (inviterId: string) => {    try {        await acceptInvitation({ inviterId });        // Automatically enable microphone and camera after accepting        openLocalMicrophone();        openLocalCamera();    } catch (error) {        console.error('Failed to accept invitation', error);    }}// User clicks "Reject"const handleReject = async (inviterId: string) => {    await rejectInvitation({ inviterId });}
```

### Feature Demo

After integrating these features, you can test guest connections with two audience members and one host: audience A enables both camera and microphone, while audience B enables only the microphone. The feature works as shown below.

## FAQs

### Guest Connection Not Working (Request/Invite/Accept/Reject Fails)

- **Issue:** Methods like `applyForSeat`, `acceptApplication`, or `inviteToSeat` do not work.
- **Cause:**`CoGuestState` relies on the underlying room engine state. This usually happens if the user hasnât joined the room, or the `useCoGuestState` context isnât initialized.
- **Solution:** Ensure the user has successfully joined the live room before calling these methods.

### Missing Guest Connection Event Notifications

- **Issue:** Audience does not receive host invitations, or host does not receive audience requests.
- **Cause:**
  - `subscribeEvent` was not called correctly.
  - Incorrect event enum value used (e.g., mixing up `CoHostEvent` and `CoGuestEvent`).
- **Solution:**
  - **Host:** Subscribe to `CoHostEvent.onGuestApplicationReceived` and `CoHostEvent.onHostInvitationResponded`.
  - **Audience:** Subscribe to `CoGuestEvent.onGuestApplicationResponded` and `CoGuestEvent.onHostInvitationReceived`.

### No Video or Audio After Guest Connection

- **Issue:**After joining as a guest, the seat list updates but thereâs no video or audio.
- **Cause:**`CoGuestState` only handles signaling for guest connections (seat assignment). Streaming (turning on microphone/camera) requires explicit calls to `DeviceState` methods.
- **Solution:** In the callback for "accept request" or "accept invitation", make sure to call `openLocalMicrophone` and `openLocalCamera`. Also, check browser autoplay policies and ensure the user has interacted with the page.
