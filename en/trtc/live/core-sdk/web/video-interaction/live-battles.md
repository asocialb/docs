# Live Battles

**AtomicXCore** includes the core [CoHostState](https://web.sdk.qcloud.com/trtc/live/web/doc/en/index.html#module-CoHostState) module, designed for managing **cross-room co-hosting**. This guide explains how to integrate and use CoHostState to build a complete co-hosting workflow for live streaming applications.

## Core Scenario

A typical host co-hosting session involves two main phases. The overall workflow is illustrated below:

## Sample Project

For a full implementation example, see our [CoHostPanel](https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/TUIKit_Vue3/blob/main/packages/tuikit-atomicx-vue3/src/components/CoHostPanel/CoHostPanel.vue) component on GitHub.

## Implementation

### Component Integration

Follow the [Quick Start Guide](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/74840) to integrate **AtomicXCore** and set up `LiveCoreView`.

> **Noteï¼**Before proceeding, make sure you have created or joined a room as described in the [Quick Start Guide](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/74840). You can then follow the steps below.

### Cross-Room Co-Hosting

The objective here is to display both hostsâ video streams in a single view. Use [CoHostState](https://web.sdk.qcloud.com/trtc/live/web/doc/en/index.html#module-CoHostState) to enable this functionality.

#### Inviter Implementation (Host A)

**Send Co-Host Invitation**

When Host A selects Host B in the UI and initiates a co-host request, call the `requestHostConnection` method:

```
import { useCoHostState, CoHostLayoutTemplate } from "tuikit-atomicx-vue3";// Get the CoHostState instanceconst { requestHostConnection } = useCoHostState();// User clicks the "Co-Host" button and selects Host B (targetLiveId)const inviteHostB = async (targetLiveId: string) => {  try {    await requestHostConnection({      liveId: targetLiveId, // Room ID of target Host B      layoutTemplate: CoHostLayoutTemplate.Grid, // Select a layout template      timeout: 30, // Invitation timeout (seconds)      extensionInfo: '', // Optional extension info    });    console.log("Co-host invitation sent, waiting for response...");  } catch (error) {    console.error("Failed to send invitation", error);    // Optionally show a Toast notification here  }};
```

**Subscribe to Invitation Result**

Use the `subscribeEvent` method from `useCoHostState` to listen for Host B's response:

```
import { useCoHostState, CoHostEvent } from "tuikit-atomicx-vue3";import { onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue';const { subscribeEvent, unsubscribeEvent } = useCoHostState();const onAccepted = (eventInfo: any) => {    console.log(`Host ${eventInfo.invitee.userName} accepted your co-host invitation`);};const onRejected = (eventInfo: any) => {    console.log(`Host ${eventInfo.invitee.userName} rejected your co-host invitation`);};const onTimeout = (eventInfo: any) => {    console.log('Invitation timed out, no response from the other party');};onMounted(() => {    subscribeEvent(CoHostEvent.onCoHostRequestAccepted, onAccepted);    subscribeEvent(CoHostEvent.onCoHostRequestRejected, onRejected);    subscribeEvent(CoHostEvent.onCoHostRequestTimeout, onTimeout);});onUnmounted(() => {    unsubscribeEvent(CoHostEvent.onCoHostRequestAccepted, onAccepted);    unsubscribeEvent(CoHostEvent.onCoHostRequestRejected, onRejected);    unsubscribeEvent(CoHostEvent.onCoHostRequestTimeout, onTimeout);});
```

#### Invitee Implementation (Host B)

**Receive Co-Host Invitation**

Host B can listen for incoming invitations from Host A by subscribing to the `onCoHostRequestReceived` event:

```
import { useCoHostState, CoHostEvent } from "tuikit-atomicx-vue3";import { onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue';const { subscribeEvent, unsubscribeEvent } = useCoHostState();const onRequestReceived = (eventInfo: any) => {    const { inviter } = eventInfo;    console.log(`Received co-host invitation from Host ${inviter.userName}`);    // Display a dialog to let the user accept or reject};onMounted(() => {    subscribeEvent(CoHostEvent.onCoHostRequestReceived, onRequestReceived);});onUnmounted(() => {    unsubscribeEvent(CoHostEvent.onCoHostRequestReceived, onRequestReceived);});
```

**Respond to Co-Host Invitation**

When Host B makes a selection in the dialog, call the appropriate method:

```
import { useCoHostState } from "tuikit-atomicx-vue3";// Get the CoHostState instanceconst { acceptHostConnection, rejectHostConnection, applicant } = useCoHostState();// Accept the invitationconst acceptInvitation = async () => {    if (applicant.value) {        try {            // Pass in the inviter's liveId (roomId)            await acceptHostConnection({ liveId: applicant.value.liveId });            console.log('Co-hosting accepted');        } catch (error) {            console.error('Failed to accept co-hosting', error);        }    } };// Reject the invitationconst rejectInvitation = async () => {    if (applicant.value) {        try {            await rejectHostConnection({ liveId: applicant.value.liveId });            console.log('Co-hosting rejected');        } catch (error) {            console.error('Failed to reject co-hosting', error);        }    } };
```

### Ending Co-Hosting

During a PK session, either host can end the co-hosting connection. You also need to handle cases where the other host leaves, so you can revert to the single-host layout.

#### End Co-Hosting Manually

To disconnect the current cross-room co-hosting session, call `exitHostConnection`. Both the inviter and invitee can use this method.

```
import { useCoHostState, CoHostStatus } from "tuikit-atomicx-vue3";// Get the CoHostState instanceconst { exitHostConnection, coHostStatus } = useCoHostState();// Handler for the "End PK" buttonconst stopPK = async () => {  // Check if currently in co-hosting state  if (coHostStatus.value === CoHostStatus.Connected) {    try {      await exitHostConnection();      console.log('Exited co-hosting');      // Reset UI layout and handle any additional business logic here    } catch (error) {      console.error('Failed to exit co-hosting:', error);    }  }};
```

#### Detect Other Host Leaving

Subscribe to the `onCoHostUserLeft` event to detect when the other host disconnects or drops due to an exception, and update your UI accordingly.

```
import { useCoHostState, CoHostEvent } from "tuikit-atomicx-vue3";import { onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue';const { subscribeEvent, unsubscribeEvent } = useCoHostState();const onUserLeft = (eventInfo: any) => {    const { userInfo } = eventInfo;    console.log(`Host ${userInfo.userName} has disconnected from co-hosting`);        // Restore single-host layout and remove the other host's video stream};onMounted(() => {    // Subscribe to user left event    subscribeEvent(CoHostEvent.onCoHostUserLeft, onUserLeft);});onUnmounted(() => {    unsubscribeEvent(CoHostEvent.onCoHostUserLeft, onUserLeft);});
```

### Demo

After integrating these features, use Host A and Host B to perform the corresponding operations. The runtime effect is shown below.

## FAQs

### Invitee Does Not Receive Co-Host Invitation Callback

If Host B does not trigger the `onCoHostRequestReceived` event after Host A calls `requestHostConnection`, check the following:

- **Parameter validation:** Confirm that the `liveId` is the actual room ID of the target host, not a user ID or other business identifier.
- **Event subscription:** The invitee must call `subscribeEvent` for the `CoHostEvent.onCoHostRequestReceived` event during component mount (`onMounted`); otherwise, notifications will not be received.

### Host Not Listed in Candidates

The `candidates` computed property automatically filters out users who do not meet the invitation criteria. If the target host is missing, possible reasons include:

- **Already filtered:**The user is already in the current co-hosting session (`connected`), has been invited (`invitees`), or is currently applying (`applicant`).
- **Self excluded:** The currently logged-in user is automatically excluded from the list.
- **List not updated:**Make sure `liveList` has been fetched correctly. You can manually call `fetchLiveList` to refresh.

### Handling Co-Host Invitation Timeout

When calling `requestHostConnection`, you can set a `timeout` (in seconds).

- **Inviter:** If no response is received within the timeout, the SDK automatically removes the user from the invitation list and triggers the `CoHostEvent.onCoHostRequestTimeout` event.
- **Invitee:**If not handled within the timeout, the same timeout event is triggered, and the `applicant` state is reset.
- **Recommendation:**Both hosts should listen for the `onCoHostRequestTimeout` event to update the UI (for example, closing the waiting popup).

### Accepting Co-Hosting Fails

Accepting co-hosting may fail due to network issues or changes in room status.

- **Error handling:**Always use `try...catch` when calling `acceptHostConnection`.
- **State check:**Before calling, verify that `applicant.value` exists and that `liveId` is valid. This helps prevent state inconsistencies due to timeouts or cancellation by the other host.
