# Achieve Cloud-Based Content Understanding

## Scenario Description

In scenarios such as remote education, showroom streaming, video conferencing, remote loss assessment, financial audiovisual recording, and online medical consultation, requirements like evidence collection, quality inspection, review, archiving, and replay often require the entire video call or live streaming process to undergo content analysis by a third-party service provider through Cloud Slicing.

## Billing Overview

For the cloud-based content understanding feature initiated through TRTC, TRTC only charges you for audio slicing and video screenshots. Meanwhile, the third-party service provider will charge you for cloud-based content understanding based on their respective billing rules. For details on the cost of audio slicing and video screenshots, refer to [Audio Slicing and Video Screenshot Billing Description.](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/64803).

## Feature Description

With TRTC's cloud-based content understanding feature, you can perform cloud slicing on each user's media stream in a room and send it to a third-party service provider for content understanding, with no need for client-side processing.

## Definitions

**Cloud moderation:** Send audio and video content to a third-party vendor via cloud slicing, obtain the results, and return them to the backend via callback.

**Cloud Slicing:** including both audio slicing and video screenshot scenarios.

**Audio Slicing:** Slice a user's audio stream in the room at specified time intervals, resulting in audio segments.

**Video Screenshot:** Capture screenshots of a user's video stream in the room at specified time intervals, resulting in images.

**File storage:** Supports storing cloud-sliced files in COS, AWS S3, or Alibaba Cloud OSS.

**Callback Notification:** We support callback notification. By configuring your callback domain, the event status of cloud moderation will notify your callback server.

## Cloud Content Understanding Process

Based on your initiated cloud content understanding request and the third-party service provider info in the request (you need to enable or purchase third-party service in advance), the audio and video content in the cloud content understanding task will be sent to the third-party content processing service provider via the cloud content understanding API for processing.

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/611e0996832011f0992e52540044a08e.png)

As shown above is a single stream recording scenario. Inside room 1234, anchor 1 and anchor 2 have both uploaded audio and video streams. If you subscribe to their media streams and set simultaneous video screenshot and audio slicing review, the backend will pull their streams separately and slice them into independent screenshot files and audio files for external content understanding service providers.

**Currently supported audit service providers include:** Tencent TIANYU, Shumei, NetEase Yidun.

## API Interface and Audit Call Concurrency Limit

The call rate limit for the cloud-based content understanding API is 20 qps (if needed, [submit a ticket](https://console.tencentcloud.com/workorder/category) to raise qps).

The API timeout duration is 6 seconds.

A single application supports 500 concurrent push streams by default. Tasks exceeding the concurrency limit will fail. If more concurrent push streams are needed, please [submit a ticket](https://console.tencentcloud.com/workorder/category) to contact us.

A single task supports up to 25 subscribed hosts in a room. Hosts occupying an upstream audio stream also count as a separate push stream.

## Cloud Content Understanding Task Execution Process

### Starting Up Cloud Content Understanding ([CreateCloudModeration](https://trtc.io/document/72648?product=rtcengine&menulabel=core%20sdk&platform=flutter))

To start a cloud content understanding task, call the REST API ([CreateCloudModeration](https://trtc.io/document/72648?product=rtcengine&menulabel=core%20sdk&platform=flutter)) through your backend service. Pay special attention to the parameterâTask ID (TaskId); this parameter is the unique identifier of the task. You need to save this Task ID as it will be required for subsequent operations targeting this task interface.

1. API for initiating cloud content understanding tasks ([CreateCloudModeration](https://trtc.io/document/72648?product=rtcengine&menulabel=core%20sdk&platform=flutter))

In the API, you need to specify the room entry parameters UserId and UserSig for assigning a streaming robot ([How to Obtain UserSig](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/35166?from_search=1&lang=en&pg=)). Ensure the UserId does not duplicate those of regular anchors or audience in your room and does not match the UserId of a streaming robot already assigned to a room in the midst of streaming; otherwise, it will lead to recording task failure.

2. Assign streaming users ([SubscribeModerationUserIds](https://trtc.io/document/36760?product=rtcengine&menulabel=core%20sdk&platform=flutter#subscribemoderationuserids))

You can also specify the blacklist and whitelist information of anchor users for streaming or exclusion through the parameter [SubscribeModerationUserIds](https://trtc.io/document/36760?product=rtcengine&menulabel=core%20sdk&platform=flutter#subscribemoderationuserids). Of course, we also support update operations during the task process.

3. Specify transfer storage location ([ModerationStorageParams](https://trtc.io/document/36760?product=rtcengine&menulabel=core%20sdk&platform=flutter#moderationstorageparams))

Storage location: Support storing to AWS S3 or COS. Specify your storage parameters in the [ModerationStorageParams](https://trtc.io/document/36760?product=rtcengine&menulabel=core%20sdk&platform=flutter#moderationstorageparams) parameter.

Image slice files are in png format, audio slicing files are in ogg format.

4. Specify content understanding service provider ([ModerationSupplierParam](https://trtc.io/document/36760?product=rtcengine&menulabel=core%20sdk&platform=flutter#moderationsupplierparam))

### Querying Cloud Content Understanding Task Status ([DescribeCloudModeration](https://trtc.io/document/72646?product=rtcengine&menulabel=core%20sdk&platform=flutter))

If necessary, you can call this API to query the task status of cloud-based content understanding.

### Modifying Cloud Content Understanding Task Status ([ModifyCloudModeration](https://trtc.io/document/72645?product=rtcengine&menulabel=core%20sdk&platform=flutter))

If necessary, you can call this API to modify task parameters, such as subscribing to blocklist/allowlist [SubscribeModerationUserIds](https://trtc.io/document/36760?product=rtcengine&menulabel=core%20sdk&platform=flutter#subscribemoderationuserids)

### Disabling Cloud Content Understanding Task ([DeleteCloudModeration](https://trtc.io/document/72647?product=rtcengine&menulabel=core%20sdk&platform=flutter))

After successful activation of the cloud-based content understanding task, you can use this API to stop it.

## Cloud Content Understanding Callback

We provide multiple callback events for the cloud-based content understanding feature to help you promptly learn about the handling and completion status of content understanding tasks.

### Cloud Content Understanding Callback Address Configuration

Tencent Real-Time Communication (TRTC) Console supports self-service configuration of callback information. Once configured, you can receive event callback notifications. For detailed operation guide, see [Callback Configuration](https://trtc.io/document/39559?product=rtcengine&menulabel=core%20sdk&platform=flutter).

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/d5e5667182f511f0a8ae5254005ef0f7.png)

### Callback API

You can provide an HTTP/HTTPS service gateway to receive callbacks and subscribe to callback messages. During the occurrence of related events, the cloud-based content understanding system will send callback event notifications to your message receiving server.

Event callback message format: HTTPS POST request sent to your server. Among them:

Character Encoding Format: UTF-8.

Request: body format is JSON.

Response: HTTP STATUS CODE = 200. The server ignores the response packet content. For protocol friendliness, it is recommended that your response content carry JSON: {"code":0}.
