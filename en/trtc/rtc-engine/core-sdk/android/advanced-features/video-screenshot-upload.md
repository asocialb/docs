# Video Screenshot Upload 

## Feature Overview

TRTC currently supports the automatic screenshot upload feature of SDK. Screenshots can be used in scenarios such as third-party review and setting cover images to meet the needs of users.

## Prerequisites

- Log in to [Console](https://console.trtc.io/) to create an RTC Engine application.
- Navigate to Application> [Advanced Features](https://console.trtc.io/features), enable the Video Screenshot Upload feature, and configure the specified storage location (currently supporting Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS) and AWS S3).

> **Note:**To use the **Video Screenshot Upload** feature, you need to purchase the RTC Engine **Pro Edition** package. For more information on monthly packages, see [RTC-Engine Monthly Packages](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/56025#).The **Video Screenshot Upload** feature will incur charges based on the number of screenshots taken. For more details, see [Fee Details](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/64803#).To use the **Video Screenshot Upload** feature, please submit a ticket to contact us for the latest version of the SDK (currently supported on Android, iOS/Mac and Windows).

## Feature Overview

1. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites), enable the feature toggle and set the storage location.
2. Use the SDK experimental interface callExperimentalAPI to utilize this feature. The parameters shall be passed as a JSON string. The parameter description is as follows:

```
{    "api": "enableAutoSnapshotAndUpload",    "params" : {    "'enable": 1, //Start/stop automatic screenshot, int, required. Field values: 0: stop, and 1: start. The passed value shall not be empty, and bool values (true and false) are supported.    "intervalS": 1, //Screenshot interval, int, optional. The interval is expressed in second, with the default value of 3 seconds and the minimum interval of 1 second. The passed value for the field shall not be empty. If it is less than 1, the minimum value of 1 second will be taken.    "streamType": 0, //Stream type, int, optional. Field values: 0: BigStream, and 2: SubStream. The passed value shall not be empty. Default behavior: If this field is not passed when starting a screenshot, the starting will not take effect. If this field is not passed, all tasks will stop when a screenshot is stopped.    "extraInfo": "customized messages" //Screenshot upload additional information, string, optional. This information will be sent to your business backend through a server-side callback.    }}
```

> **Note:**The screenshot upload task will only start after the enterRoom is successful.It is recommended to call this method after the startLocalPreview is successful to avoid screenshot upload task failure.

## Receiving Server-side Event Callbacks

### Configuration Information

TRTC Console supports self-configured callback information. Once configured, you can receive event callback notifications. For detailed directions, see [Callback Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/39559#).

> **Note:**You need to prepare the following information in advance:**Required**: The HTTP/HTTPS server address to receive callback notifications.**Optional**: The [key](#key) for calculating the signature. It is a key of up to 32 characters defined by you, consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers.

### Timeout Retry

If the event callback server does not receive a response from your server within 5 seconds after sending a message notification, it is considered a notification failure. After the first failure, an immediate retry is attempted. Subsequent retries will occur at 10-second intervals until the message retention time exceeds 1 minute, after which no further retries will be made.

### Format of Event Callback Message

The event callback message is dispatched to your server via HTTP/HTTPS POST requests, in which:

- **Character Encoding Format**: UTF-8.
- **Request**: The body is in JSON format.
- **Response**: HTTP STATUS CODE = 200. The server ignores the specific content of the response package. For the sake of a friendly protocol, it is recommended that the response content from a customer shall carry JSON: {"code":0}.
- **Package Example**: The following is a package example of the "Retweet Time Group - CDN Streaming in Progress" event.

### Callback Message Parameters

The header of the event callback message contains the following fields:

| Field name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Content-Type | application/json |
| Sign | Signature value |
| SdkAppId | sdk   application id |

The body of the event callback message contains the following fields:

| Field name | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EventGroupId | Number | Event group ID, the value of a screenshot event (EVENT_GROUP_SCREEN_SHOT) is 6 |
| EventType | Number | The event type of the callback notification, the value of a video screenshot (EVENT_TYPE_VIDEO_SCREENSHOT) is 601 |
| CallbackTs | Number | The Unix timestamp when the event callback server sends a callback request to your server, expressed in millisecond |
| EventInfo | JSONObject | Event information |

Description of event information :

| Field name | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| eventId | String | The event ID for this callback |
| callbackData | String | Screenshot upload additional information, reported via the client's extraInfo |
| pictureURL | String | The URL of the screenshot |
| code | Number | Task execution status code, default: 0, indicating that the task is executed successfully |
| msg | String | Description information of task execution |
| roomID | String/Number | Room ID |
| streamType | String | Stream type of the screenshot, BigStream orSubStream |
| userID | String | Screenshot username |
| timestamp | Number | UTC timestamp of the screenshot, accurate to millisecond |

### Callback Request Example

```
{   "EventGroupId": 6,   "EventType": 601,    "CallbackTs": 1698410059705,   "EventInfo": {       "eventID": "ap-guangzhou-1400000000-1698410059243691647-60022-jpg.jpg",       "callbackData": "test",       "pictureURL": "https://sotest-1200000000.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/1400000000/ap-guangzhou-1400000000-1698410059243691647-60022-jpg.jpg",       "code": 0,       "msg": "",       "roomID": "464884",       "streamType": "BigStream",       "userID": "dd",       "timestamp": 1698410059693    } }
```

### Calculating Signature

The signature is calculated by using the HMAC SHA256 encryption algorithm. When your event callback receiver receives a callback message, it calculates the signature in the same way. If the signatures match, it indicates that the callback is from Tencent Cloud Real-Time Audio and Video and has not been tampered with. The calculations of the signature are as follows:

```
//In the calculation formula of Sign, the key is the encryption key for calculating the Sign.Sign = base64 (hmacsha256(key, body))
```

> **Note:**The body is the original package of the callback request you received. **Do not perform any transformations; it is imperative to preserve in its entirety, including \\n\\t escape characters.** An example is provided below:body="{\\n\\t\\"EventGroupId\\":\\t1,\\n\\t\\"EventType\\":\\t103,\\n\\t\\"CallbackTs\\":\\t1615554923704,\\n\\t\\"EventInfo\\":\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\"RoomId\\":\\t12345,\\n\\t\\t\\"EventTs\\":\\t1608441737,\\n\\t\\t\\"UserId\\":\\t\\"test\\",\\n\\t\\t\\"UniqueId\\":\\t1615554922656,\\n\\t\\t\\"Role\\":\\t20,\\n\\t\\t\\"Reason\\":\\t1\\n\\t}\\n}"

```
