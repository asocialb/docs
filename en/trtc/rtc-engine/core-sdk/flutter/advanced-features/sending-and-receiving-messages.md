# Sending and Receiving Messages

## Overview

The TRTC SDK provides the ability to send custom messages. With this feature, any user whose role is an anchor can broadcast their own custom messages to other users in the same video room.

## Supported Platforms

| iOS | Android | macOS | Windows | Electron | Flutter | web |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| â | â | â | â | â | â | Ã |

## How It Works

A user's custom message will be combined into the audio/video data streams and transmitted to other users in the same room alongside. As audio/video channels themselves are not completely reliable, in order to improve the reliability, the TRTC SDK implements a reliability guarantee mechanism internally.

## Sending Messages

Messages are sent by calling the `sendCustomCmdMsg` API of TRTCCloud, and the following four parameters need to be specified during sending:

| Parameter Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| cmdID | Message ID. Value range: 1â10. Messages in different business types should use different `cmdIDs`. |
| data | Message to be sent, which can contain up to 1 KB (1,000 bytes) of data. |
| reliable | Whether reliable sending is enabled; if yes, the receiver needs to temporarily store the data of a certain period to wait for re-sending, which will cause certain delay. |
| ordered | Whether orderly sending is enabled, i.e., whether the data should be received in the same order in which it is sent; if yes, the receiver needs to temporarily store and sort messages, which will cause certain delay. |

> **Note:**`reliable` and `ordered` must be set to the same value (`YES` or `NO`) and cannot be set to different values currently.

Objective-C

Java

C++

C#

Dart

```
// Sample code for sending a custom message- (void)sendHello {    // Command word for the custom message. A set of rules needs to be customized according to the business needs. 0x1 is used as an example to send a text broadcast message    NSInteger cmdID = 0x1;    NSData *data = [@"Hello" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];    // `reliable` and `ordered` need to be consistent for now. Orderly sending is used as an example here    [trtcCloud sendCustomCmdMsg:cmdID data:data reliable:YES ordered:YES];}
```

```
// Sample code for sending a custom messagepublic void sendHello() {    try {        // Command word for the custom message. A set of rules needs to be customized according to the business needs. 0x1 is used as an example to send a text broadcast message        int cmdID = 0x1;        String hello = "Hello";        byte[] data = hello.getBytes("UTF-8");        // `reliable` and `ordered` need to be consistent for now. Orderly sending is used as an example here        trtcCloud.sendCustomCmdMsg(cmdID, data, true, true);    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {        e.printStackTrace();    }}
```

```
// Sample code for sending a custom messagevoid sendHello(){    // Command word for the custom message. A set of rules needs to be customized according to the business needs. 0x1 is used as an example to send a text broadcast message    uint32_t cmdID = 0x1;    uint8_t* data = { '1', '2', '3' };    uint32_t dataSize = 3;  // Length of data    // `reliable` and `ordered` need to be consistent for now. Orderly sending is used as an example here    trtcCloud->sendCustomCmdMsg(cmdID, data, dataSize, true, true);}
```

```
// Sample code for sending a custom messageprivate void sendHello(){    // Command word for the custom message. A set of rules needs to be customized according to the business needs. 0x1 is used as an example to send a text broadcast message    uint cmdID = 0x1;    byte[] data = { '1', '2', '3' };    uint dataSize = 3;  // Length of data    // `reliable` and `ordered` need to be consistent for now. Orderly sending is used as an example here    mTRTCCloud.sendCustomCmdMsg(cmdID, data, dataSize, true, true);}
```

```
try {  int cmdId = 0x1;  String hello = "hello";  _trtcCloud.sendCustomCmdMsg(cmdId, hello, true, true);} catch (e) {  print(e);}
```

## Receiving Messages

After a user in a room uses `sendCustomCmdMsg` to send a custom message, other users in the room can receive the message through the `onRecvCustomCmdMsg` API in the SDK callback.

Objective-C

Java

C++

C#

Dart

```
// Receive and process messages sent by other users in the room- (void)onRecvCustomCmdMsgUserId:(NSString *)userId cmdID:(NSInteger)cmdId seq:(UInt32)seq message:(NSData *)message{    // Receive the message sent by `userId`    switch (cmdId)  // `cmdId` agreed upon between sender and receiver    {    case 0:        // Process the message with `cmdId` = 0        break;    case 1:        // Process the message with `cmdId` = 1        break;    case 2:        // Process the message with `cmdId` = 2        break;    default:        break;    }}
```

```
// Inherit `TRTCCloudListener` and implement the `onRecvCustomCmdMsg` method to receive and process messages sent by others in the roompublic void onRecvCustomCmdMsg(String userId, int cmdId, int seq, byte[] message) {    // Receive the message sent by `userId`    switch (cmdId)  // `cmdId` agreed upon between sender and receiver    {    case 0:        // Process the message with `cmdId` = 0        break;    case 1:        // Process the message with `cmdId` = 1        break;    case 2:        // Process the message with `cmdId` = 2        break;    default:        break;}
```

```
// Receive and process messages sent by other users in the roomvoid TRTCCloudCallbackImpl::onRecvCustomCmdMsg(                            const char* userId, int32_t cmdId, uint32_t seq, const uint8_t* msg, uint32_t msgSize){    // Receive the message sent by `userId`    switch (cmdId)  // `cmdId` agreed upon between sender and receiver    {    case 0:        // Process the message with `cmdId` = 0        break;    case 1:        // Process the message with `cmdId` = 1        break;    case 2:        // Process the message with `cmdId` = 2        break;    default:        break;    }}
```

```
// Receive and process messages sent by other users in the roompublic void onRecvCustomCmdMsg(string userId, int cmdId, uint seq, byte[] msg, uint msgSize){    // Receive the message sent by `userId`    switch (cmdId)  // `cmdId` agreed upon between sender and receiver    {    case 0:        // Process the message with `cmdId` = 0        break;    case 1:        // Process the message with `cmdId` = 1        break;    case 2:        // Process the message with `cmdId` = 2        break;    default:        break;    }}
```

```
TRTCCloudListener(  onRecvCustomCmdMsg: (userId, cmdId, seq, message) {    // TODO  },  onMissCustomCmdMsg: (userId, cmdId, errCode, missed) {    // TODO  });
```

## Use Limits

Since custom messages have a higher transmission priority than audio/video data, if too many of them are sent, audio/video data may be interfered with, resulting in video lagging or blurring. Therefore, the following frequency limits apply to custom messages:

- As custom messages are broadcast to all users in the same room, up to 30 messages can be sent per second.
- A data packet (i.e., data size) can be of up to 1 KB; if the threshold is exceeded, the packet is very likely to be discarded by the intermediate router or server.
- A client can send up to 8 KB of data in total per second, that is, if each data packet is of 1 KB, up to 8 packets can be sent per second.
