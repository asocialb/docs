# Sensing Network Quality

This document primarily discusses how to perceive the quality of the current network.

## Check network quality during the call

TRTC offers a callback event known as **onNetworkQuality**, which reports the current network quality to you every two seconds. Its parameters include two parts: localQuality and remoteQuality.

- **localQuality**: Represents your current network quality, divided into 6 levels, which are Excellent, Good, Poor, Bad, VeryBad, and Down.
- **remoteQuality**: Represents the network quality of remote users. This is an array, each Element (XML) in the array represents the network quality of a remote user.

| Quality | Description |
| --- | --- |
| unknown | Unperceived |
| excellent | The present network is exceedingly good |
| good | The current network is fairly good |
| poor | Current network is average |
| bad | Present network quality is poor, it might cause noticeable stutters and communication delays |
| vBad | The current network conditions are abysmal, TRTC can barely maintain a connection, yet it can't guarantee the quality of communication |
| down | The current network does not meet the minimum requirements of TRTC, obstructing the normal audio and video conversation |

All you need is to monitor TRTC's onNetworkQuality and make corresponding prompts on the interface:

```
TRTCCloudListener(    onNetworkQuality: (localQuality, remoteQuality) {      switch(localQuality.quality) {        case TRTCQuality.unknown:          //TODO: Handle this case.          break;        case TRTCQuality.excellent:          // TODO:Handle this case          break;        case TRTCQuality.good:          // TODO: Handle this case.          break;        case TRTCQuality.poor:          // TODO: Handle this case.          break;        case TRTCQuality.bad:          // TODO: Handle this case.          break;        case TRTCQuality.vBad:          // TODO: Handle this case.          break;        case TRTCQuality.down:          // TODO: Handle this case.          break;      }            for (TRTCQualityInfo info in remoteQuality) {        // TODO: Handle this case.      }    });
```
