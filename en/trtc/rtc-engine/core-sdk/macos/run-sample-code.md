# Run Sample Code

This document describes how to quickly run the demo for the TRTC macOS SDK.

# Prerequisites

- Xcode 11.0 or later.
- A valid developer signature for your project.
- Qt Creator 4.13.3 (macOS) or later.

# Steps To Run Demo

## Step 1. Download the Demo

Download the [Mac](https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/TRTC_Mac) sample demo code on github, or run the following command in a terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/TRTC_Mac.git
```

We offer OC and Swift for you to choose from:

- **OCDemo:** run `pod install` in a terminal window after entering the directory of your project, and take no notice of other steps in [iOS SDK Importing](https://trtc.io/document/35092).
- **SwiftDemo:** download the [SDK](https://liteav.sdk.qcloud.com/download/latest/TXLiteAVSDK_TRTC_Mac_latest.tar.bz2) required for the project and move the unzipped `TXFFmpeg.xcframework`/`TXSoundTouch.xcframework`/`TXLiteAVSDK_TRTC_Mac.xcframework`/`dSYMs` files to **TRTC_Mac/SDK** folder.

## Step 2. Configure the Demo

1. Log in to the [TRTC Console](https://console.trtc.io/) and click **Create Application**. If you have already done so, you may skip this step.
2. And then, your own `SDKAppID` and `SDKSecretKey` of your created application can be obtained in the **Basic Information** section.

3. Replace the values of **SDKAPPID** and **SDKSECRETKEY** in the `GenerateTestUserSig.h` file in the `TRTCDemo/TRTC` directory with the information obtained in Step 2. For **SwiftDemo**, it's the `GenerateTestUserSig.swift` file under `API-Example/Debug` directory.

> **Noteï¼**In the demo above, we used **SDKSecretKey** to generate **UserSig** locally in order to help you go through the demo easier. However, in the production environment, you are not supposed to generate userSig in this way, which may lead to **SDKSecretKey** leakage, thereby creating a chance for attackers to steal your TRTC traffic. **The correct way to generate UserSig is to integrate**[**Server-Side Generation of UserSig**](https://trtc.io/document/35166)**on your server.** When an user enters the room:Send a http request to your server.Generate a UserSig on your server.Return it to the user to enter the room.When you deploy your page to a production environment, you need to have your page accessed through the HTTPS(e.g. `https://domain/xxx`). For the reason, please refer to the document [Page Access Protocol Restriction Description](https://web.sdk.qcloud.com/trtc/webrtc/v5/doc/en/tutorial-05-info-browser.html#h2-3).

## Step 3. Run the Demo

- **OCDemo:**Open the `TRTCDemo.xcworkspace/API-Example.xcworkspace` project in the source code directory with Xcode (11.0 or later), then compile and run the TRTC-API-Example project.
- **SwiftDemo:**Simply compile and run the API-Example project.
