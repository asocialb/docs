# Sensing Network Quality

This document primarily introduces how to perceive the quality of the current network.

## Detecting Network Quality during Call

TRTC provides a callback event called **onNetworkQuality**, which reports the current network quality to you every two seconds. Its parameters include two parts: localQuality and remoteQuality.

- **localQuality**: Represents your current network quality, which is divided into 6 levels, namely Excellent, Good, Poor, Bad, VeryBad, and Down.
- **remoteQuality**: Represents the network quality of remote users. This is an array where each element represents the network quality of a remote user.

| Quality | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Unknown | Unperceived |
| 1 | Excellent | The current network is excellent. |
| 2 | Good | The current network is good. |
| 3 | Poor | The current network is moderate. |
| 4 | Bad | The current network is poor, and obvious lag and call latency may occur. |
| 5 | VeryBad | The current network is very poor. TRTC can only barely keep-alive, but cannot guarantee communication quality. |
| 6 | Down | The current network fails to satisfy the minimum requirements of TRTC, and normal audio and video calls cannot be performed. |

You only need to listen to TRTC's onNetworkQuality and provide corresponding notifications on the interface:

```
// Create a TRTC instance.const trtcCloud = TRTCCloud.sharedInstance();// Listen to the onNetworkQuality callback and perceive changes in the current network status.const onRtcListener = useCallback((type: TRTCCloudListener, params: any) => {  if (type === TRTCCloudListener.onNetworkQuality) {     console.log("local user", params.localQuality);     params.remoteQuality.forEach((user: any) => {       console.log("remote user", "id=" + user.userId + ",quality=" + user.quality);     });  }}// Register a callbacktrtcCloud.registerListener(onRtcListener);
```

## Detecting Network Quality before Call

### Principle of Speed Test

![](https://cloudcache.intl.tencent-cloud.com/cms/backend-cms/774df7df257211f0a62e525400454e06.png)

- The principle of speed test is that the SDK sends a batch of probe packets to the server node, then calculates the quality of the returned packets, and notifies the speed test results through the callback API.
- The speed test results will be used to optimize the SDK's subsequent server selection strategy. Therefore, it is recommended that you perform a speed test before the user's first call. This will help us select the best server. Meanwhile, if the test results are highly unsatisfactory, you can prompt the user through a prominent UI to choose a better network.
- Speed test result ([TRTCSpeedTestResult](https://liteav.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/product/trtc/dart/api/en/trtc_cloud_def/TRTCSpeedTestResult-class.html)) includes the following fields:

| Field | Meaning | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| success | Whether it is successful | Whether this test is successful. |
| errMsg | Error message. | Detailed error information of the bandwidth test. |
| ip | Server IP address | IP address of the testing server |
| quality | Network quality scoring | The network quality calculated by the evaluation algorithm, with lower loss and smaller rtt, results in a higher score. |
| upLostRate | Uplink packet loss rate | Range is [0 - 1.0]. For example, 0.3 means when sending 10 packets to server, 3 may be lost midway. |
| downLostRate | Downstream packet loss rate | Range is [0 - 1.0]. For example, 0.2 means when receiving 10 packets from server, 2 may be lost midway. |
| rtt | Network delay | Time consumed for SDK to communicate with server round-trip. The smaller this value is, the better. The normal value is between 10 ms and 100 ms. |
| availableUpBandwidth | Uplink bandwidth | Predicted uplink bandwidth, unit: kbps. -1 indicates an invalid value. |
| availableDownBandwidth | Downstream bandwidth | Predicted downstream bandwidth, unit: kbps. -1 indicates an invalid value. |

### How to Conduct a Speed Test

1.You can start the speed test feature through the `startSpeedTest` functionality of TRTCCloud.

```
// Call startSpeedTest to start the speed test.const trtcCloud = TRTCCloud.sharedInstance();const param: TRTCSpeedTestParams = {  expectedDownBandwidth: 10, // Expected downstream bandwidth (kbps, value ranges from 10 to 5000, no test when it is 0)  expectedUpBandwidth: 10,   // Expected uplink bandwidth (kbps, value ranges from 10 to 5000, no test when it is 0).  scene: 1,                  // 1: Delay test. 2: Delay and bandwidth test. 3: Online chorus testing.  sdkAppId: 0,               // Application identifier  userId: "",                // User identity  userSig: "",               // User signature  }trtcCloud.startSpeedTest(param);const onRtcListener = useCallback((type: TRTCCloudListener, params: any) => {  if (type === TRTCCloudListener.onSpeedTestResult) {     console.log('Speed test result:', params);     setSpeedTestResult(params);  }}
```

2.The speed test result will be returned through the onSpeedTestResult callback function.

```
// Return results through the onSpeedTestResult callback functionconst trtcCloud = TRTCCloud.sharedInstance();const onRtcListener = useCallback((type: TRTCCloudListener, params: any) => {  if (type === TRTCCloudListener.onSpeedTestResult) {     console.log('Speed test result:', params);     setSpeedTestResult(params);  }}trtcCloud.registerListener(onRtcListener);
```

| Enumeration Types | Description |
| --- | --- |
| availableDownBandwidth | Downstream bandwidth (kbps, -1: invalid value). |
| availableUpBandwidth | Uplink bandwidth (kbps, -1: invalid value). |
| downJitter | Downlink packet Jitter (ms), indicating the stability of data communication under the current network environment for the user. The smaller this value, the better. The normal value range is 0 ms - 100 ms. -1 means the speed test did not successfully measure a valid value. Generally, the Jitter of a WiFi network is slightly larger than that in a 4G/5G environment. |
| downLostRate | Downstream packet loss rate. The value ranges from [0 - 1.0]. For example, 0.2 means when receiving 10 packets from the server, 2 may be lost midway. |
| errMsg | Error information of the bandwidth test. |
| ip | Server IP address. |
| quality | Internal network quality calculated by the evaluation algorithm. Details as follows:quality = 0: undefined.quality = 1: The current network is excellent.quality = 2: The current network is good.quality = 3: The current network is moderate.quality = 4: The current network is poor.quality = 5: The current network is very poor.quality = 6: The current network fails to satisfy the minimum requirements of TRTC. |
| rtt | Latency (ms): Refers to the Round-Trip Time (RTT) from the current device to the TRTC server. The smaller the value is, the better. The normal value range is 10ms - 100ms. |
| success | Whether the test is successful. |
| upJitter | Uplink packet Jitter (ms): Refers to the stability of data communication under the current network environment of the user. The smaller the value is, the better. The normal value range is 0ms - 100ms. -1 represents that no valid value was successfully measured in this speed test. Generally, the Jitter of a WiFi network is slightly larger than that in a 4G/5G environment. |
| upLostRate | Uplink packet loss rate. The value ranges from [0 - 1.0]. For example, 0.3 means when sending 10 packets to the server, 3 may be lost midway. |
