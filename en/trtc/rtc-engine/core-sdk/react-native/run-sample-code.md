# Run Sample Code

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to get started with TRTC React Native SDK through

[our sample project.](https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/TRTC_ReactNative)

## Prerequisites

- React Native 0.63 or later
- Node (later than v12) & Watchman
- **If you are targeting Android platform:**
  - Android Studio 3.5 or later
  - Devices with Android 4.1 or later
- **If you are targeting iOS and macOS platform:**
  - Xcode 11.0 or later
  - OS X 10.11 or later
  - A valid developer signature for your project
- For how to set up the environment, see the React Native [official document](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

## Account setup

You have [signed up for a Tencent Cloud account](https://trtc.io/register?s_url=https://console.trtc.io).

## Directions

### Step 1. Create an application in your TRTC console

1. Log in to the [TRTC console](https://console.trtc.io/), click **Create Application**in the **Applications**section.
2. In the popup page, enter your application name, select **RTC Engine**, and then click **Create**.

> **Noteï¼**An application name can contain up to 15 characters. Only digits, letters, Chinese characters, and underscores are allowed.Tags are used to identify and organize your Tencent Cloud resources. For example, an enterprise may have multiple business units, each of which has one or more TRTC applications. In this case, the enterprise can tag TRTC applications to mark out the unit information. Tags are optional and can be added or edited according to your actual business needs.

### Step 2. Get your application's `SDKAppId` and `SecretKey`

Select the application you just created and obtain its `SDKAppID` and `SDKSecretKey` in the **Basic Information** section. This information will be used later in [project configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/59412#step-3.-configure-the-project).

### Step 3. Download the project

1. Download our SDK and demo code from [GitHub](https://github.com/LiteAVSDK/TRTC_ReactNative/tree/main/TRTC-Simple-Demo), or run the following command to clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/LiteAVSDK/TRTC_ReactNative.git
```

2. Switch to the `TRTC_ReactNative/TRTC-Simple-Demo` directory, and run the following commands to install dependencies.

```
yarn install
```

### Step 4. Configure the project

Open `/TRTC-Simple-Demo/debug/config.js` directory, and fill in the following parameters:

- `SDKAPPID`: your application's `SDKAppID` from step 2.
- `SDKSECRETKEY`: your application's `SDKSecretKey` from step 2.

> **Noteï¼**The method for generating `UserSig` described in this document involves configuring `SDKSECRETKEY` in the client code. In this method, `SDKSECRETKEY` may be easily decompiled and reversed, and if your key is disclosed, attackers can steal your Tencent Cloud traffic. Therefore, **this method is only suitable for the local execution and debugging of TRTC-Simple-Demo**.The best practice is to integrate the calculation code of `UserSig` into your server and provide an application-oriented API. When `UserSig` is needed, your application can send a request to your server for a dynamic `UserSig`. For more information, see [How do I calculate UserSig during production?](https://www.tencentcloud.com/zh/document/product/1047/34385)

### Step 5. Configure permission requests

Before building and running the project, the following permission requests must be configured:

Android

iOS

1. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /><uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" /><uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" /><uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" /><uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" /><uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" /><uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" /><uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" /><uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" /><uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" /><uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" /><uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" />
```

> **Noteï¼**Disabling hardware acceleration will result in failure to render remote videos. Please ensure that **hardware acceleration is not disabled** (do not use `android:hardwareAccelerated="false"`).

2. On Android platform, audio and video permissions must be requested manually, for example:

```
if (Platform.OS === 'android') {  await PermissionsAndroid.requestMultiple([    PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.RECORD_AUDIO, //For audio calls    PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.CAMERA, // For video calls  ]);}
```

Add the following permissions in `Info.plist`:

```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key><string>You can make video calls only if you grant the app camera permission.</string><key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key><string>You can make audio calls only if you grant the app mic permission.</string>
```

### Step 6. Build and run the project

Start Metro in the demo directory.

Android

iOS

1. Start Metro in the demo directory.

```
npx react-native run-android
```

2. Open a new window in the demo directory and start debugging.

```
npx react-native run-android
```

1. Run `pod install` in the demo iOS directory to install dependencies.
2. Start Metro in the demo directory.

```
npx react-native start
```

3. Open a new window in the demo directory and start debugging. if an error occurs, please use Xcode to debug your project.

```
npx react-native run-ios
```
