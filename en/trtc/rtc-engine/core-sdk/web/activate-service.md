# Activate Service

## Activate Trial Service

You can follow these steps to activate Tencent RTC-Engine product service and create an application with the default trial version. Enjoy free usage to experience basic audio and video features, including: Audio/Video Call, cloud recording, Cloud-based Mixed-stream Transcoding, Relay to CDN for Cloud Live Streaming (CSS), and AI conversation service.

All Tencent Cloud accounts (UINs) with a monthly subscription package for Tencent RTC (including Call, Conference, Live, RTC-Engine) can receive a free usage package of 10,000 minutes per month within 1 year. A maximum of one free usage package can be received per month, and all TRTC (including Call, Conference, Live, RTC-Engine) generated usage is deductible. For details, see [Free Minutes Description](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/42735?lang=en&pg=).

> **Note:**Remaining minutes per month will expire on the last day of the current cycle and cannot be used in the next cycle.For example, the free usage package received on November 15, 2022 has a validity time from November 15, 2022 to December 14, 2022.Note: You can view the specific effective time in the [package management](https://console.trtc.io/package) section of the console.If the deducted minutes do not exceed 10,000, the service is free this month. If the 10,000-minute free quota is exhausted and no [RTC-Engine monthly package](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/56025), [Call monthly package](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/54632), [Conference monthly package](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/59409), or [Live monthly package](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/59407) is purchased, the application will be suspended. After suspension, the service cannot be automatically restored. You need to [purchase a package](https://console.trtc.io/subscription) to reactivate it. After service resumption, the complimentary free minutes can continue to be used.
