# Billing of On-Cloud Recording and Recording Delivery

There are three parts to the TRTC recording feature: [On-Cloud Recording](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/45176#On-CloudRecording), which involves recording audio and video streams in a TRTC room in the cloud, [Web Page Recording](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/45176#402d1803-472e-44f5-8744-9b180ccffb66)ï¼which mix the contents of the page and audio from any browser, and [Recording Delivery](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/45176#RecordingDelivery), which is delivering recording files to the specified storage location.

If you have a contract with TRTC, the billing details in the contract will apply.

## On-Cloud Recording

### Billing Composition

Two types of fees may be charged for using on-cloud recording:

#### **Recording Robot Subscription Fees**

To start a recording task for a TRTC room, the system will assign to the room a recording robot, who will act as a virtual audience member and will subscribe to the audio and video streams that need to be recorded. Fees will be charged based on the duration of the audio and video streams received by the robot. For details, see [Billing of Audio and Video Duration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/42734).

#### **On-Cloud Recording Fees**

After the recording robot subscribes to the streams, the recording process starts. Recording fees are charged based on the recording duration, and the price varies with the aggregate video resolution.

### Billing Details

- Billing method: The usage will first be deducted using the [10,000 free minutes](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/42735) provided by TRTC for each developer account per month. Usage beyond the monthly free minutes will be billed on a daily pay-as-you-go basis, as long as your account is not suspended.
- Billing cycle: Billing occurs on a daily basis. On-cloud recording fees incurred each day will be deducted the following day at the time of billing. The detailed billing and invoicing time will be based on the actual [Billing Statement](https://console.tencentcloud.com/expense/bill/overview).
- Within the same cloud-recording task, when generating recording files in multiple formats, separate recording duration fees will be charged for each format.

### Billing Formula

**On-cloud recording fees**  =  **Audio duration**  x  **Unit price of audio duration**  +  **Video durations of different types**  x  **Unit price of the corresponding type**

### Billing Price

Video recording usage is categorized into the following four types according to the aggregate resolution of each recording process. The fees for each type are calculated separately.

| Category | Video Usage Type | Aggregate Resolution Range | Unit Price (USD/1,000 Min) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Audio recording | - | - | 1.49 |
| Video recording | HD | Aggregate resolution â¤ 921,600 (1280 x 720) | 5.99 |
|  | FHD | 921,600 (1280 x 720) < Aggregate resolution â¤ 2,073,600 (1920 x 1080) | 13.49 |
|  | 2K | 2,073,600 (1920 x 1080) < Aggregate resolution â¤ 3,686,400 (2560 x 1440) | 23.99 |
|  | 2K+ | 3,686,400 (2560 x 1440) < Aggregate resolution â¤ 8,847,360 (4096 x 2160) | 53.99 |

### Usage Calculation

> **Noteï¼**Durations are calculated in seconds and then converted to minutes by day (rounded up to the nearest minute).If only one stream is recorded, and the stream has an audio-only segment followed by a video segment, the audio-only segment will be charged as audio recording, and the video segment will be charged as video recording.If a segment of a recording duration includes both audio-only streams and video streams, it will only be charged as video recording.A recording process is a recording task that is started and stopped using APIs.

- Recording duration: The time from when a recording process starts to when it stops.
  - Video recording usage: The total duration of segments where video is recorded in all recording processes in a room.
  - Audio recording usage: The sum of recording durations of all recording processes in a room minus the video recording duration. If a segment of a recording duration has neither video nor audio recorded, it will still be charged as audio recording usage.
- Factors affecting duration calculation
  - Duration calculation is affected by the number of recording processes. If multiple recording processes are started within a room, the duration of each process needs to be calculated and included in the total recording service usage for that month.
- Duration calculation is not affected by the number of audio and video streams recorded. The duration of streams recorded by the same recording process will not be added up. For example, if a recording process simultaneously records two video streams for 5 minutes, the billable recording duration will be 5 minutes, and the fees will be charged based on the aggregate resolution of the two streams.
- During the recording process, the recording robot subscribes to the audio and video streams that need to be recorded, which incurs TRTC audio/video duration fees.

### Billing Examples

This section describes how TRTC calculates aggregate resolution, recording durations, and recording fees.

#### Example 1

If a recording process simultaneously records two video streams with a resolution of 960 Ã 720, the aggregate resolution of this recording process would be 960 Ã 720 + 960 Ã 720 = 1,382,400. The recording process would be billed as FHD video recording usage.

#### Example 2

Suppose you have a project named testRTC under your Tencent Cloud account. In addition to using audio/video services, the project also records and saves audio/video interactions.

**Recording 1**

On February 11, 2022, four users had a video call that lasted for 5,000 seconds. One on-cloud recording process was started to record four audio streams.

Usage: 5,000 seconds of audio recording duration in total.

**Recording 2**

On February 12, 2022, four users had a video call that lasted for 5,000 seconds. Two on-cloud recording processes were started. One was single-stream recording and the other mixed-stream recording. Four audio streams were recorded in each process.

Usage: 5,000 + 5,000 = 10,000 seconds of audio recording duration in total.

**Recording 3**

On February 13, 2022, four users had a video call that lasted for 3,500 seconds. One on-cloud recording process was started to record four audio and video streams. Each video stream had a resolution of 640 x 360.

Usage: 3,500 seconds of HD video recording duration in total.

| Streams Received | Resolution Calculation | Aggregate Resolution | Recording Duration Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Audio/Video streams of 4 anchors | 640 x 360 x 4 | 921,600 | HD |

**Recording 4**

On February 14, 2022, three users interacted over video for 1,800 seconds, and their video resolutions were 640 x 360, 1280 x 720, and 960 x 720 respectively. After 1,800 seconds, a fourth user entered the room and interacted for 540 seconds, and the user's video resolution was 1920 x 1080. One on-cloud recording process was started to record the audio and video streams of all users throughout the process.

Usage: 1,800 seconds of FHD video recording duration and 540 seconds of 2K+ video recording duration.

| Streams Received | Resolution Calculation | Aggregate Resolution | Recording Duration Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Audio/Video streams of 3 anchors | 640 x 360 + 1280 x 720 + 960 x 720 | 1,843,200 | FHD |
| Audio/Video streams of 4 anchors | 640 x 360 + 1280 x 720 + 960 x 720 + 1920 x 1080 | 3,916,800 | 2K+ |

**Fee calculation (total fees of the above four recordings)**

| Billable Item (Recording Type) | Duration (Min) | Fees (USD) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audio | 250 | (250/1000) x 1.49 = 0.3725 |
| HD | 59 | (59/1000) x 5.99 = 0.35341 |
| FHD | 30 | (30/1000) x 13.49 = 0.4047 |
| 2K+ | 9 | (9/1000) x 53.99 = 0.48591 |
| Total | - | 1.61652 â 1.62 |

## Web Page Recording

### Billing Composition

The page recording service mixes the specified URL webpage content with audio and video into one file. During page recording, select the output resolution. Billing is based on the output file's selected output resolution duration.

### Billing Details

Billing mode: Post-payment billing after daily settlement.

Billing cycle: Daily. The page recording fee for each day will be deducted when the billing statement is issued on the next day. The detailed billing and billing time shall be subject to the actual [Billing Statement](https://console.tencentcloud.com/expense/bill/overview).

### Billing Formula

Page recording fee = Output duration amount Ã Corresponding output video resolution tier price

### Billing Pricing

By calling the [Web Page Recording](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/72325) feature, you can record the contents of any browser page with audio mixing, and billing is based on the duration of the final generated audio and video file.

List price is as follows:

| Billing Type | Resolution type | Output Resolution | Unit Price (USD/1,000 Min) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web Page Recording(Output Resolution) | HD | Not higher than 1280 Ã 720 (inclusive) | 14 |
|  | Full HD | 1280 Ã 720 - 1920 Ã 1080 (inclusive) | 28 |

### Usage Calculation

The billing duration for page recording is calculated based on the output duration of recordings under the same Tencent Cloud account, used as usage statistics for the recording service.

> **Note:**Duration statistics accuracy is in seconds. The accumulated seconds are converted into the number of minutes for billing, with less than one minute rounded up to one minute.When initiating a page recording request task, the recording duration starts counting upon url loading completion. The url loading stage is not included in the duration calculation.

### Billing Example

Assuming a user starts a page recording task, performs page recording for 10 minutes, and sets the output resolution to 1280 Ã 720 (HD).

The total cost of page recording generated inside the TRTC room = duration of page recording Ã Ultra-High Definition Unit Price for Web Page Recording = 14 USD/1,000 minutes Ã (10 minutes / 1,000) = 0.14 USD.

## Recording Delivery

The recording delivery service is a supporting service that delivers and stores generated recording files to a specified bucket during the period of using Real-Time Communication (TRTC) audio/video cloud recording service.

> **Note:**Billing adjustment: The billing rule for the recording delivery feature was adjusted starting from 00:00 on September 1, 2025. After adjustment, this feature has been converted to a free service, and fees will no longer be charged for this service thereafter. Note that recording delivery fees generated before 00:00 on September 1, 2025 cannot be refunded. Thank you for your understanding and support.
